written by [[J.L Mackie]]

Believer accepts:
1. God exists an an omnipotent, all-good, all knowing being
2. Good works to eliminate evil as far as it can
3. There are no limits to what an omniscient and omnipotent being can do
4. Therefore, if God exists, he eliminates all evil
5. Therefore, no evil exists
6. But evil exists - Contradiction

### 4 Theistic defenses:
#### 1. Evil is a necessary counter-part to good
Good and evil are logically/conceptually interrelated: disguised comparative terms (comparison class is implied)

e.g., big and small, X is big
- Comparative claim: X is bigger than some y and y is smaller
- The concept of big cannot exist without the concept of small

Good and evil are comparative terms
- Impossible for the concept of good to exist without the concept of evil
- EG: X is good means that:
	- X is better (more good) than Y and
	- Y is worse (more evil) than x
- A perfect God cannot eliminate evil because evil is logically/conceptually necessary for good to exist

**Mackie's response**
1. Restricts God's omnipotence
	1. But omnipotence doesn't entail doing what is logically impossible, e.g., making a 3 sided square
2. Good and evil are not like big and small
	1. God's goodness is not just perceived as "better than"
	2. God is inherently good

#### 2. Evil is a necessary means to good
What does this mean? 
Not that good requires evil, but evil causes good; its a way to bring about goodness

**Mackie's response**
- Limits God's omnipotence by claiming that he must adhere to casual laws

#### 3. The universe is better with some evil in it than it would be if there were no evil
1. Contrast and discord **heightens** beauty
	1. Music - chords, melody
2. Progress is more valuable than maintaining a static decision
	1. Privileged -> success    **vs**    hardships -> success
		1. Hardships to success is much more moving and impactful than the former
	2. Overcoming challenges, facing fears
	3. Improving bad habits

Going through first order evils builds second order goods
- e.g., a physical injury that involves pain could build courage and resilience, develop sympathy, and motivate one to help others

**How this defends:**
- First order evil of physical pain leads to more valuable 2nd order goods
- God enhances goodness by injecting evil
- Therefore, God and evil are not incompatible

**Mackie's response**
Second-order evils can also result from first-order evils, which are worse than first-order
- Poverty leads to callousness and an unwillingness to help others, malevolence, ill will, bitterness, hopelessness

#### 4. Evil is due to human free will
Humans create evil through exercise of their free will
Combined with d3:
- 2nd order evil (eg, cruelty) is permitted because it sustains greater good of human freedom
Good of human freedom:
- Not automatons
- When courageous, benevolent, heroic acts are freely (not deterministically) committed, they are more valuable

**Mackie's response**
1. Couldn't have God have made people so that they freely choose what is right?
2. Dilemma:
	1. Having freedom is acting according to your character -> God is responsible -> God is not all good
	2. Freedom not caused by character, but random  -> God is not responsible for evil, but freedom is no longer valuable -> Doesn't justify evil
