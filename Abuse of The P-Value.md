#### The p-value is overused and abused
A p-value of 0.05 or less is usually treated as a statistically significant finding worthy of publication. But a p-value of 0.05 does not mean a given hypothesis is 95% likely to be correct. Rather, a p-value of 0.05 just means that if the null hypothesis is true, and all other assumptions are valid, a 5% chance exists of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the observed result.

There is a possibility of getting an incorrectly low p-value just based on chance
