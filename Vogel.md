### Criticized [[Skepticism]]

#### The problem of [[skepticism]] has its roots in the underdetermination of theory by evidence
- theory: common sense belief
- evidence: sensory experience, individual + patterns & irregularities
- underdetermination: evidence does not justify our common sense beliefs - alternative hypotheses can also explain these experiences
#### evidence is not enough to explain our common sense beliefs about the world. However...

Vogel (373)
""...when the choice arises, we hold to the common-sense view, and reject its skeptical competitors"

##### But what [[Epistemic Reasons]] can we have for doing so?
Common-sense beliefs (Real World Hypothesis, RWH) provide a better explanation of our sensory experiences!

### Vogel's standards for a good explanation:
1. Ad hoc components should be avoided
	- Ad hoc components are unintegrated/do not cohere with the rest of the explanation
		- ie, during a court case, a defendant claims that all witnesses are pathological liars
2. Depth
	- The higher level/more you explain the explanation, the better
	- If the explanation can account for more things, it is preferable to an explanation that accounts for less
3. Simplicity
	- ie [[Principle of Parsimony - Ockham's Razer]]
	- Theories that don't invoke new concepts, new entities, etc
	- Burden of proof falls on proposer of more complicated explanation


#### Example:
RWH: Snow is falling!
Objects that explain our experience and why and how these objects behave that way

SH(Skeptical Hypothesis): A demon created an impression that snow is falling; no actual snow
- why does the demon care about us?
	- A second demon put them up to it
	- Ad hoc
- No explanation
	- No higher-level explanation

#### Does this defeat skepticism?
Skeptic response: no - a better explanation doesn't equate to truth

### Vogel's Question:
**Can a SH be just as explanatorily good as a RWH?**

All objects are represented as mirrored objects
All causal effects are represented as mirrored effects

End up with a SH world that exactly replicates the real world, which makes a world identical to ours - **Computer Skeptical Hypothesis (CSH)**

#### Computer Skeptical Hypothesis
Example: we spill coffee on ourselves
RWH: I spilled my hot coffee when a car outside backfired, I burn myself
CSH: 1:1 correlation
1. Coffee computer program -> visual and tactile impression of hot cofee
2. Car back-firing program -> impression of sound
3. Spill program -> visual and tactile impression of spilling cofee, burn
Causal relationships mirrored:
- Car back-fire program activated spill program

Upshot: CSH is just as structurally coherent, deep and simple as the RWH


**Any reason to think that the RWH is better than the CSH?**
Simplicity:
CSH: Requires a highly sophisticated computer
- CSH more complex?

Vogel: But RWH has a diversity of objects
- RWH could be more complex

Depth:
Where did the computer come from?
Vogel: RWH has unexplained origins

#### Vogel's Take

CSH is a better explanation:
- Consider not just the structure but the content of the explanation- what items are being posited? What features do they have?
- RWH: posits actual physical objects which explains their behavior
- CSH: nonphysical simulations that require additional rules to explain why they act like physical objects
Therefore, RWH is simpler

**Example**
RWH: Coffee cup on my desk
- Observe the cup, its location
- No other object can occupy this space at the same time
Why not?
- Necessary feature of physical objects
- No further empirical rue or law required to explain this

CSH: No actual cup
- Program simulates cup impression
	- RWH: every object has a different physical location
	- Isomorphic CSH: each object has a different pseudo location
- CSH will need additional principles to explain why two objects can't be assigned the same pseudo location (outside of necessary truths)

### Why the RWH > CSH
P1) The RWH posits physical objects whose behavior is explained by the necessary features of physical objects
P2) but, the CSH posits computer simulations of physical objects
P3) Therefore, the CSH will have to introduce additional principles/rules to explain why these simulations act like physical objects
C) Therefore, the CSH is more complicated than the RWH
