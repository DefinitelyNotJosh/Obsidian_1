#### Correlation
Describes association/dependence between two variables
- positive - one var increases, other increases
- negative - one var increases, other decreases
##### Can be measured using the correlation coefficient
- Population corr. coeff - $\rho$
- sample corr. coeff - $R$
Strength described as $|R|$$

#### Strength of correlation

| Value of $R$ | Strength of correlation |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
|              | Weak                    |
|              | Moderate                |
