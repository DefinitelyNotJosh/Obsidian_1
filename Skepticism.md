### We don't know what we thought we did
#### - Different from "ordinary"/"acceptable" skepticism
#### - Radical/global skepticism: We don't know anything

#### [[Descartes]]
Goal: Achieve absolute certainty; indubitable beliefs
- Method: examine foundations/sources of beliefs

Foundation 1: Sensory Experiences - could these ever mislead us? Yes
### [[Dreaming Argument]]

Knowledge based on reasoning alone
- Math
### [[Malicious Demon Argument]]

### Descartes' Argument for Global Skepticism
P1: I can't rule out the possibility that all my sensory experiences are just a part of a dream
P2: I can't rule out the possibility that an evil demon is deceiving me
C1: Therefore, neither my senses nor my reasoning produce absolute certain belief
P3: Knowledge requires absolute certainty
C2: Therefore, I can't use my senses or my reasoning to acquire knowledge


### Meditation 2:
Is there anything I know without a doubt?
- God?
- Myself?
But...
- What if I am dreaming and all my sensory experiences are false??
- What if there is a malicious demon filing me with false beliefs?

But, if you are aware of your thinking, you know that your thinking is real

Therefore, "I am, I exist" is necessarily true every time I cutter it or conceive it in my mind
- Every time you're aware of your own thinking, you are absolutely aware that you exist
- Descartes: so long as I'm thinking I can be sure of my existence because I cannot be thinking AND not exist
Does that mean he stops existing if he stops thinking?
- No, making a claim about the knowledge his existence not about his existence generally
#### But what is he?
- A body with hands and eyes? - can't trust his senses
- A rational animal? - can't trust his senses
- Concludes that he must be a thinking thing
	- Capable of thought, reasoning(although the reasoning can't be used to draw knowledge)
#### What about the knowledge of the rest of the world?
- Possible false beliefs about the existence of others, objects
- How can he be certain that he knows that the external world really exists



### Meditation 3:
- Finds an idea of God within himself, an idea of an infinite and perfect being
Descartes reasons:
- "What is more perfect cannot come into being from what is less perfect"
	- Perfection cannot be caused be a less-than-perfect source
- Therefore, his idea of God must have come from God
So...
- A perfect God must exist
#### But...
- Such a God wouldn't allow me to be deceived
- But... I do make mistakes
- I must clearly and distinctly form my ideas to avoid mistakes

#### Knowledge of the external world:
1. A perfect God exists
2. If a perfect God exists, he would not permit me to be constantly deceived
3. So long as I clearly and distinctly form my judgements, I achieve absolute certainty in my beliefs about the external world
4. I can have knowledge about the external world!
