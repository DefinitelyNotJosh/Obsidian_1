### $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + \ldots + b_n X_n$
- $b_0$ = Y-intercept of sample [[Multiple Regression]] function which is the fitted value of Y when $X_1=X_2=\ldots = X_n =0$
- $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ = slope in respect to particular predictor variable
##### $b_0$ has practical meaning when $X_1=X_2=\ldots = X_n =0$  are meaningful values and samples exist at/near the Y-intercept
##### $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ always has a practical meaning


#### Interpreting residual standard error
Like [[Simple Linear Regression (SLR)]], several quantities use residuals $$
