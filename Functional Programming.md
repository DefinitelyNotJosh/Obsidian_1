Limiting what we can do with programs makes us better programmers

-  Takes away side effects
No changing variables
No assigning memory

Why do this? How do we even program without them?
- Not just giving up variables, shifting our focus
Arguably one of most important developments with imperative programming was the introduction of functions

In some form or another, functions are basis for everything

### What makes functional programming what it is?

#### Higher order functions
- Can pass functions as arguments
- Can return functions from other functions

#### Example of a higher order function: #### Example of a higher order function:
