### Involves the claim that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false
##### - e.g, All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal
##### - Salim is a bachelor, therefore, he is an unmarried male

### Math, logic, definitions

- If you accept the truth, it is illogical to deny the conclusion

### Evaluation:
#### 1. Validity
1. Valid: It is impossible for conclusion to be false if we assume truth of premises
2. Invalid: It is possible for conclusion to be false if we assume truth of premises
Testing for validity:
- Assume premises are TRUE
- In light of assumption, can conclusion be false?
	1. If yes: invalid
	2. no: valid
Validity does not track ACTUAL truth of premises
#### 2. Soundness
1. Sound: [[Arguments]] is valid and has TRUE premises
2. Unsound: [[Arguments]] is invalid OR has one or more FALSE premises OR both


### Argument Forms

#### Valid: 
**Modus Ponens**
	If A, then B

If we know things about the world, then we must know them with absolute certainty. We do not know them with absolute certainty. Therefore, we don't know things about the world.
