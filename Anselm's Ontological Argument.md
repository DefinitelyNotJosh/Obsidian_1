### Definition of God proves God's existence

#### God: Greatest Conceivable Being

God exists in the mind
It is greater to exist in reality than the mind alone
God has to exist in reality and in the mind if he's the greatest conceivable being

**Formalization**
P1: God is understood/defined as the GCB
P2: Therefore, God exists in the mind
P3: It is greater to exist in reality and the mind than the mind alone
P4: If God existed only in the mind, then it would be possible to conceive of something greater(a being that exists in reality)
P5: But then, the GCB would not be the GCB
P6: This is impossible
C: Therefore, God exists in reality and the mind

Criticisms:
- If God's power is by definition unfathomable, how can we establish him absolutely as the GCB?

#### Guanilo's Objection
If you call anything the greatest conceivable version of itself, according to this argument, it will automatically exist in reality

**Formalization**
P1: If it is always better to exist in reality than the mind alone, then the greatest conceivable island would have to exist in the mind and in reality
P2: But this is absurd
C: Therefore, defining God as the GCB and assuming that its better to exist in reality than the mind alone does not prove God's existence
