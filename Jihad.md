### 'Exertion' or 'struggle' toward God - 'holy war' is misleading

#### One undertakes jihad by heart, tongue, hands, and sword
- the Greater jihad is the struggle to lead a good and virtuous life
- the Lesser jihad refers to the right or duty of defending Islam of the Muslim community against oppression or injustice (war theory in Christianity)
