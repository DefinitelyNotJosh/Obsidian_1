Part 1

1000 of each image type

part 2

extract color histogram from images

put histograms into text file

1 line per image/histogram

pre-pend 1 for histogram, -1 for histogram without aurora, rest of line for rest of histogram

append line with "#<file name\>" to make sanity check easy

Build perceptron that will lean to classify color histograms as yes/No aurora
- normalize histogram values

Don't train the third group of images



part 3

build simple perceptron with step activation function
- take color histogram as input and return single output, 1 if aurora 0 otherwise

80% of the data for training, 20% of the data for validation

Test different batch sizes - 20 is a good start

Perform experiments with learning $\mu$ = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 1.5

INCLUDE PLOT:
Training error and classification accuracy vs training epoch

maybe include accuracy, precision, recall measures


part 4

Run group of images on "not known" through perceptron - how it do? 

How did I do when assigning labels/deciding if the image as the aurora or not?
