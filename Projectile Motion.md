### X = X0 + V0xt + 1/2(0)t^2
### Y = Y0 + V0yt + 1/2(-9.8)t^2

Applies when in air and no forces besides gravity


### F = MA
#### Sum of X components: Fx = MAx
#### Sum of Y components: Fy = MAy


#### Tension = (mass of the cart)(A)


Graph is going to be Tension as a function of Acceleration

Hanging weight = Tension when holding cart so A = 0
