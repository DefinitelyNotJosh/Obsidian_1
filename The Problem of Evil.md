Solutions that won't work

1. Evil is an illusion of the human mind
	1. Bible references to evil
2. God is doing the best he can!
	1. God is not omnipotent, abandons faith in an infinite God
3. Matter just IS evil
	1. Evil represents something gone wrong in a fundamentally good creation


#### A division of evil:

**Moral evil:**
- Evil that arises from human ill-will/incompetence
	- Racial genocide, oppression injustice
	- Poverty, disease
**Nonmoral/natural evil:**
- Pain and suffering arising independently of human will
- Hurricane, storm, earthquake
	- Boundaries not always clear, but some suffering occurs outside of human error and malice

#### Accounting for Moral Evil
**"Person" = being with freedom**

- NOT unconditional
	- Can't violate laws of physics, but free thinkers
- Self-directing/autonomous
	- Authority in our beliefs, actions
	- Not automatons
- Implication:
	- Persons are free to act wrongly OR rightly

**This means:**
- Being a person entails the possibility of wrongdoing/sinful choices
	- Possibility of wrongdoing is logically inseparable from persons
	- "A person who can infallibly guarantee to always act rightly is self-contradictory" (Hick, 40)

So...
- In creating people, God had to allow for the possibility of sinful decisions

1. To be a person means to have freedom
2. Freedom entails the possibility of wrongdoing
3. Therefore, to be a person is to possess the capacity for wrongdoing
4. Therefore, God could not have created without the capacity for wrongdoing
5. Therefore, we can rationally reconcile the existence of evil with a perfect God


**Concerns**
1. Denial of omnipotence
	1. Creating such a person is logically impossible!
		1. Amounts to creating a person who isn't a person!
		2. meaningless conjunction of words
			1. Square with three sides
			2. Circle with right angles
		3. God's omnipotence is NOT challenged
2. Why did God create persons?
	1. Only persons could freely enter into a meaningful personal relationship with God


#### Nonmoral evil
**Skeptics assume:**
- We are born as complete beings
- God (because perfect)would create paradise for people

**Misaligns with Christian teachings**
- We are born flawed, incomplete
- Adversity causes us to become petter people-- "soul making":
	- Courage, compassion, resilience
- Improvement impossible with predictable physical consequences, real dangers, dependable laws:
	- discipline, perseverance, understanding

1. Humans are not born perfect, but instead, need to develop moral qualities
2. A hedonistic paradise would not promote personal growth
3. But a world with nonmoral evils (natural disasters and predictable consequences) would allow for personal growth
4. Therefore, we can rationally reconcile the presence of such evils with the existence of a perfect God


**Objection:**
- What if people grow selfish, resentful, apathetic because of their misfortune?
- What if their lives don't improve?

**Hick's response:**
- Soul-making continues after life on earth
