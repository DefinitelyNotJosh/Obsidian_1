Simple random sampling - random units selected from population

Systematic sampling - every k'th unit from a population of N is chosen

Stratified sampling - population divided into groups(strata), samples within each strata are chosen randomly in proportional matter

Cluster sampling - population divided into groups(clusters), sample constructed randomly by selecting 1+ clusters

Convenience sampling - units from a subset of the population that are readily available
