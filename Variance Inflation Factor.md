[[Coefficient of Multiple Determination]]
#### Reciprocal of $1-R^2$ for each predictor variable $$VIF= \dfrac{1}{1-R^2}$$

Gives percentage that the variance is increased for each regression coefficient due to [[Multicollinearity]]
- EX - VIF of 1.5 indicates variance of given coefficient is 50% higher than would be expected with no multicollinearity
- Higher VIF = greater problem
- 1 shows no multicollinearity
- greater than 4 or 5 = multicollinearity problems
- greater than 10 = serious issues
