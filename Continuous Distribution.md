A [[Probability Density Function (PDF) (Continuous)]] is specified for a continuous interval, unlike a [[Probability mass function (PMF) (Discrete)]] which is specific for discrete points

- infinite number of possible outcomes within that interval
- probability density f(x) is probability per unit value of x, given by the PDF - NOT THE PROBABILITY
- Area under PDF for a specific interval gives the probability of an outcome being within that interval
- #### The probability of any singular outcome in an interval occurring is 0!!!
	- no area under curve of a single value
	- infinite options within interval, chance a particular value selected is 0

### 1.  [[Normal or Gaussian Distribution]] that uses [[Z-Score]] and the [[Z-Table]]

### 2. Uniform Distribut
