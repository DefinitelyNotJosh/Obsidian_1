### If a is identical as b, that all the properties will be properties of b

Ex. - Superman is the same person as Clark Kent

### Differences between mental states and brain states:

Alleged Difference 1:
P1: Even babies can know they're in pain
P2: But, they don't know that they're in any particular brain state
C: Therefore, pains can't be the same as brain states

Objection: as it could be just a lack of knowledge on the subject's part, not a genuine difference between pain and brain states

Alleged Difference 2:
#### Multiple Realizability Objection
P1: Dogs, cats, sharks, etc, can feel pain
P2: But, these organisms don't have C-Fibers
C: Therefore, pain can't be the same as C-Fiber activation

Objection: the mental state of people are different than animals
- Retort: The [[The Identity Theory]] needs to find a reason to explain all pain

**Defenses?**
Individuate pain by species
Dog pain is "d-fiber" activation
Octopus pain is "o-fiber" activation
Human pain is "c-fiber" activation

Mental states = brain states
**Objection:**
**Even within species, different brain states can produce the same mental states**
