1. Parameter of interest - From problem context, identify the parameter of interest (mean for us most of the time)
2. Null hypothesis $H_0$ - State the null hypothesis $H_0$
3. Alternative hypothesis $H_a$/$H_1$ - Specify an appropriate alternative hypothesis, $H_a$/$H_1$
4. Test statistic - state an appropriate test statistic
5. Reject $H_0$ if: Define the criteria that will lead to rejection of $H_0$
6. Computation - Compute any necessary sample quantities, substitute those into the equation for the test statistic, and compute that value
7. Conclusion - Decide whether or not $H_0$ should be rejected and report that in the problem context. This could involve computing a p-value or comparing the test statistic to a set of critical values
