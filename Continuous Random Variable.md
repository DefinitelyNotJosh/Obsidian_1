Can take on any value within a range of values, like the real numbers between 0 and 1
- Typically measured

#### Mean $\mu$
also the expected value or $E(X)$, is a measure of the center of the distribution. Weighted average of the possible values of the random variable, with the [[Probability Density Function (PDF) (Continuous)]] providing the weights
- Graphically, were the pivot is places so the PDF balances
#### Variance $\sigma^2$
measure of spread of a distribution. Variance, like the mean, is a weighted average, weights also provided by PDF
#### Standard deviation $\sigma$
Another measure of spread, $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

Integral calculus is required to compute the three quantities in the case of continuous random variables
