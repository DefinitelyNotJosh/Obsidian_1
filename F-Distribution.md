#### In a sample w multiple groups taken from independent populations, variability can be partitioned into between-group variability and within-group variability. The F-statistic is the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance

#### Quantities involved:
#### Sum of squares between groups: $$SSB =  \displaystyle\sum_{j = 1}^k n_j (\overline{X_j} - \overline{X})^2$$
where $n_j$ is the number of observations in the $j$th group, $k$ is the number of groups, $\overline{X}_j$ is the sample mean for the $j$th group, and $\overline{X}$ is the overall mean
#### Mean squares between groups: $$ MSB = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{j = 1}^k n_j (\overline{X_j} - \overline{X})^2}{(k-1)}$$ Sum of squares within groups: $$$$
