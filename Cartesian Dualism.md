### AKA dualistic interactionism
### By [[Descartes]], 1596-1650

#### Thesis 1: Minds and brains are distinct types of substances:
- Mind: nonphysical substance
- Brain: physical substance
- Body: physical substance

What this means:
- Mind is not one and the same as the brain
- Mind is not constituted by the brain
#### Thesis 2: Mental states can cause changes in the brain and body, vice versa

Desire->brain->behavior

Sensory organs->brain->pain

### Motivations

Accommodates our pre-theory intuitions
1. Brain and mind are distinct
2. Brain and mind causally interact
3. Aligns with religious beliefs - immaterial souls

### Problem
#### [[Causal Interaction]]
