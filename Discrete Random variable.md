Can take on a countable number of distinct values like the integers between 0 and 100
- Typically counted

###### The **mean** or **expected value $\mu$** of a discrete random variable $X$ is the sum of the possible values of X multiplied by the probability of the value. $$\mu = E(X) = \sum{(x*p(x))}$$
Keep in mind, computing the mean does not always make sense for a discrete random variable
###### The **variance** of a discrete random variable $X$ is a measure of the spread of a distribution.$$\text{variance} = \sigma^2=V(X)=\sum{((x-\mu)^2*p(x))}$$
 ###### The **standard deviation** is:$$\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^2}=\sqrt{\text{variance}}$$
