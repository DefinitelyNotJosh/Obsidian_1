Essay: Religion and Rocketry by CS Lewis
The consequences of encountering alien life

CS Lewis
- Christian author
- Known for Chronicles of Narnia series and Mere Christianity
- Born Nov 29 1898, Died Nov 22 1963

As with most scientific discoveries, such as the discovery of the earth not being the center of the universe, Darwinism, and modern psychology, the secular side and the Christian side end up arguing for a while until eventually ending up in pretty much the same place as they were before. Aliens probably won't be any different. However, if life is ever found, there's a supposed big threat to Christianity.
### Big threat
- Against the doctrine of the reincarnation
- Why did God become a man and die for mankind, and not die for other races? If we find that there are millions of other races, how could we, without extreme arrogance, believe that we're uniquely favored?

- Will become formidable as soon as we know the answer to 5 other questions:
### 5 Questions

### 1. Are there animals anywhere except on earth?

### 2. If there are, do these animals have "rational souls"?
- The ability to comprehend values
- Do they know what "good" is, and not "good" as in what benefits "me" or what benefits my species, but objective goodness
- Could be hard to tell - it's not impossible for aliens to be smart enough to talk, but not spiritual
##### If not, then it makes sense why humans are special

### 3. If there are rational species, are they "fallen" like humanity?
- Christ didn't die because humanity is great - he died because humanity is awful and not worth dying for - Christ died so that we could be worth dying for
- A creature that deserved redemption wouldn't need to be redeemed
### 4. If they are rational and are fallen, have they been denied redemption?
- Jesus may have incarnated and died on other worlds - but what if he didn't?
### 5. Is Jesus the only path to redemption?
- There might be other remedies to the sin condition that God applied to aliens - we probably wouldn't recognize them as remedies to sin
- What if the other species need to be saved through the human Jesus?
	- If so, it doesn't imply that humanity is special - Jesus was born in a stable, after all. Not exactly the most attractive place to begin life

#### The answer to the big question? - we'll cross that bridge if we get there

### What happens if we meet other species?
##### In an ideal world: 
- we interchange thoughts and ideas
- if they're smarter than us or us them, we still connect with one another and help one another
##### We don't live in an ideal world.
Probable outcome:
- Look at examples of what humanity does to other species, or even other humans that happen to look slightly different
- People cheat, enslave, murder, and corrupt
- Some people don't, but the odds that those who don't are the ones who are risking their lives in space? They're low. More likely greedy adventurers and ruthless technical experts. 
- The explorers will subdue the alien race if they're weaker than us - if the aliens are stronger, they'll be wiped out
##### What if they were an "unfallen" race?
- We would exploit their innocence
- Good men would be racked with guilt
	- Afterwards, people would try to attempt to atone for their evil - maybe send missionaries

#### Overall:
We should stand against all exploitation and theological imperialism
- We'll be called traitors to humanity
- Most people will hate us - and yet we shouldn't compromise a bit
- Loyalty is to God, not to our species - we should side with those who are the sons and daughters of God. They would be more our brothers and sisters than the humans who shun them

##### What if the universe's expanse is a quarantine measure by God to limit the spread of "spiritual infection"?
