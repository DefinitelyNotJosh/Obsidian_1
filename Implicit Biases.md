### Unconscious tendencies to associate concepts with one another

Can be :
- Prevalent, neutral - make social situations more convenient
- Can be harmful - Tendency to associate certain traits with members of a particular social group

**Examples/Support**
### 1. CV
- Implicit biases not limited to particular groups
- Carefully considered judgements affected by unrelated background
### 2. Prestige
- Experts working within their fields are not immune to implicit biases
### 3. Perception
- Raw perceptions are affected
#### Harms:
- Unfair to people: jobs, education, praise, recognition, credibility
- Physical harm
- Reinforcing stereotypes

### New form of skepticism
[[Skepticism]] - we don't know the things we thought we did

How IBs lead to skepticism
- Implicit biases - Accept/reject arguments, claims, evidence we should not be
	- Professional/academic settings
	- Any context when we can recognize apparent social identity (loans, medical treatment, social interactions, instructors)
- We form most of our beliefs in these contexts
- So... past beliefs and present beliefs are likely to be false and/or unjustified because influenced by false, harmful implicit biases

IB -> Bias-Related Doubt -> Past and present beliefs may be false/unjustified due to false/harmful biases

### Jennifer Saul believes that Bias Related Doubt is more serious than traditional skepticism

#### Why?
1. BRD generates stronger doubts about our knowledge - more compelling, because there's actual evidence we're making bias-related mistakes; no evidence of skeptical scenarios
2. BRD challenges the idea that we are responsible enquirers and can trust ourselves, but traditional skeptical scenarios do not - we can't trust ourselves because our reasoning is subconsciously guided
3. In the case of BRD, we have a moral obligation to change our belief-forming practices and the ability to do so

#### Objection
**We're really bad at probability** - eg, coin flipping, plane crashes

P1) We routinely make errors in our probability judgements
P2) But we know when these will occur, what beliefs these will affect, and what to do about it
P3) Therefore, such errors do not give rise to skeptical worries
P4) In the same way, our implicit biases affect a known subset of our beliefs and can be avoided
C) Therefore, our implicit biases also don't give rise to a serious form of skepticism

#### Saul's response
Wide scope
- Implicit biases affect us in any context we can identify social identity
- Past beliefs are irreparably affected 
Probability errors affect only the cognitive process employed to evaluate likelihood, but implicit bias errors affect a wide range of cognitive faculties
