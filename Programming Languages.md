Goal of Programming Languages is to help organize thoughts
- We first programmed with vacuum tubes
- Moved to punch cards
- moved to assembly
- Finally, FORTRAN - machine independent, can write expressions, can call functions


### [[Imperative Programming]]

### [[Rust]]
### [[C++]]

### [[Haskell]]

### [[Paradigms]]
### [[Prolog]]




**Why?**
Some languages good at specific tasks
- Good at programming, terrible at database
new perspective at programming
- functional and logic programming look completely different
your boss told you too
- If everyone is using the same language, you will too

are all languages the same?
- No, all have their own quirks and features

ex. JavaScript has very aggressive typecasting so there isn't any type errors when loading webpages


### [[Functional Programming]]
### [[Object Oriented Programming]]
### [[Structured Programming]]


#### [[Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)]]

### [[Recursion]]


Language:
#### [[JSON language]]


### [[Control Flow]]
