**Send me these things at least 24 hrs before our scheduled meeting:**

1. Update your 4-year plan spreadsheet with your current courses and planned courses until graduation.
#### Send me your answers to the following questions:
a. How are your classes going this semester?
 - Going pretty well. Classes are difficult and workload is high, but I'm managing fine all things considered.
b. What is your plan for helping yourself successfully do all the career tasks below? 
- Get most of them done during spring break. I've already attended the career fair and talked to quite a few companies. Unfortunately, not many had software engineering positions available, so I didn't have much luck on the job front.
c. How will you practice coding this summer?
- I've got a few personal project ideas on the backburner right now, so I'll probably get started on those and maybe get a LeetCode routine.
 d. What concerns or questions do you want to discuss at the advising meeting?
 - We covered all my major schedule concerns I could think of in the advising meeting in the fall. A minor concern is that I need to fill up my schedule to keep scholarship funds, so I'd appreciate some input on what classes to take that would give me credits and be fun to take.
