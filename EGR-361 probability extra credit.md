Calamityville has 100 years of disaster data collected
- An earthquake occurred in 10 of the years - P(E) = 10/100 = 0.1
- A fire has occurred in 10 of the years - P(F) = 10/100 = 0.1
- In one of the years an earthquake occurred, a fire also occurred
- A severe flood occurred in 8 of those years - P(FL) = 8/100 = 0.08
- A severe drought occurred in 10 of those years - P(D) = 10/100 = 0.1


1. The probability of having an earthquake or fire is adding P(E) and P(F) and then subtracting the intersection of the two: 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.01 = 0.019
2. The probability of having a drought and flood in the same year, assuming we have all the data we need to know, is 0, as there is no report of an overlap between floods and droughts. Plus, intuitively, it wouldn't make much sense.
3. Fires and earthquakes are not mutually exclusive, as we see that they can occur in the same year from the data. The events are also independent, as the probability of a fire occurring when an earthquake occurs (1/10 = 0.1) and vice versa is equal to the overall probability of a fire occurring (P(F) = 0.1).
4. Floods and earthquakes appear to be mutually exclusive events, as they don't have any overlap in years. They also appear independent, as there is no evidence to show that one causes the other.
5. Earthquakes and fires are still not mutually exclusive, as they occur at the same time. However, now, the probability of a fire happening given an earthquake (2/10 = 0.2) is higher than the overall probability of a fire occurring (P(F) = 0.1). Therefore, fires and earthquakes are dependent events.
