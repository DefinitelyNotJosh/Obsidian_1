[[Operators]] are part of the [[syntax]]
- Java operators:
	- =
	- .
	- +
	- -
	- etc


#### [[Double]]
Can do:
	a + b
	a - b
	a * b
	a / b

#### [[Int]]
Can do:
	x + y
	x - y
	x * y

- whenever an [[int]] is involved in a calculation with a [[double]], it converts the [[int]] into a [[double]]


#### [[String]]

- The only class types where you can define a literal

### There are infinite [[Class Types]] in Java
