#### Parsimony is simplicity
### Of competing theories which purport to explain the same phenomenon, prefer the simplest
- It posits the fewest number of entities

#### Example: 
You read the newspaper and a bunch of people got sick at a restaurant
So, either:
- The restaurant had a common ingredient that was bad
- Ghosts of past chefs are haunting the restaurant

#### Why?
Burden of proof falls on advocate of more complicated theory, when a simpler one will do
