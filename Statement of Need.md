UP website sucks for everyone

Students, alumni, staff, future students, parents/guardians of future students

We need more user interaction/time on site

Being redesigned to acommodate for this

Game will increase user time on site 

Make the site not fall victim to "corporate feel"

Will require some funds, but as demands for current game aren't large, it will be less than a rounding error on a UP budget

Development is currently free - But we are open to compensation if UP decides



Question:
Leaderboard - aiming to use a database system. Which one? - AppWrite

Got any idea of what foundation you'll use?
Run locally or on the cloud?
- How to host? Computation power? Parameter count idea?
