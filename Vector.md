Vector notation must provide information about both the vector's magnitude, and its direction

A scalar cannot be added to a vector

X                 =                X I

variables don't matter, can be anything



To add vectors, line them up back to front, and measure the start to the end
- order doesn't matter for adding vectors

Just add a negative vector to subtract
