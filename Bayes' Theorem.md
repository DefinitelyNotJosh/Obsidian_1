#### Bayes Theorem
Relates the probability of an event $A$ given a condition $B$ to the probability of condition $B$ given that the event $A$ occurred. In a nutshell, allows $P(B|A)$ to be calculated from $P(A|B)$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the events in the same sample space such that $P(A)=0$ and $P(B)\neq0$. Then, 
#### $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\overline{A})P(\overline{A})}$$
