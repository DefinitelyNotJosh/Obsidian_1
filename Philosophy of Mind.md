Philosophy of Mind studies the nature of the mind:
1. How should we understand the mind (our psychological states)?
2. What is the connection between the mind and the brain?

What do we mean "the mind?""
- An entity: Bearer of mental states
- Mental states:
	- Propositional attitudes: Beliefs, desires, hopes; attitude towards a proposition; indicated by 'that'
	- Sensations: pain, itches, tickles; there is something it feels like to be in this state
	- Processes: learning, perception, memory

What's meant by "the brain?"
Neural states, processes, structures
- Amygdala, hippocampus
- Neurotransmitters - serotonin, dopamine
- Neurons and their parts - dendrite, axon

What we are asking: What's the relationship between the mind (as entity/events) and the brain?

#### Why philosophers are involved:
Philosophy: Given...
- empirical evidence (neuroscience, psychology, etc)
- judgements about our mental states and our experiences
how should we understand our minds?
#### Why is it a puzzle?
We tend to think of the mind and brain differently:
1. Descriptions:
	1. Brain states: physical (tangible, gray, weight, frequency of impulses)
	2. Mental states: nonphysical (weight??)
2. Representationality
	1. Mental states: representational; beliefs, perceptions; correct/incorrect
	2. Brain states, processes: non-representational, not truth-evaluable
3. Asymmetry in Access: Two differences-
	1. Introspective access: I can introspect and know my mind, not my brain
	2. Privileged access: I have privileged, authoritative access to my mind compared to others, but everyone has the same access to my brain

^^ These considerations suggest that the mind != brain
#### **But...**
We also tend to associate the mind with physicality:
- Assign temporal and spatial location:
	- When and where you had a particular thought
	- Where your mind is located
- We think minds interact in the physical world:
	- Mental states cause changed in our brain and body
	- Bodily/physical states cause changes to our mental states

^^ These considerations suggest that the mind is physical, and likely identical to the brain
