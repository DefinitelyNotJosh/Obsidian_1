####  ICA
a) number of people who fill up their water bottle at a drinking fountain in some period of time - Poisson
b) Whether the drinking filter spontaneously clogs after a certain number of fills - Geometric
c) The number of times you accidentally bite your lip during lunch - Binomial
d) Number of those accidental bites that draw blood - Binomial
e) number of accidental bites until you draw blood - Geometric
#### Poisson and Exponential inherently tied together by rate factor $\lambda$
#### Binomial and Geometric inherently tied together by fixed probability of success $p$

### [[Normal or Gaussian Distribution]]

### [[Unimodal Distribution]]
### [[Sample Distribution]]
### [[Standard Error]]
### [[T-Distribution - T-Test]]


### Unimodal/Normal distribution
one prevalent peak in histogram
- One stddev in normal distribution chart covers 67% of all observations
- Two stddev covers 95% of all observations
- Three = 99.9% of all observations
### Bimodal
Two prevalent modes
### Multimodal
Multiple prevalent modes

### Skewed left
mode on the right with tail on left

### Skewed right
mode on left with tail on right
