### Friction is an intermolecular force

##### 2 types of friction in PHY-204 - Static and Kinetic
Coefficient of Static Friction: u sub s
Coefficient of Kinetic Friction: u sub k

Magnitude of kinetic friction: f sub k = u sub k * n
Magnitude of static friction: f sub s <= u sub s * n

n =  normal force
