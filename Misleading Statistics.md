### Common misuses:
- Correlation doesn't equal causation
- Bad data - sample sizes are too small
- Bias - questions could be, knowingly or not, asked in a biased way
- Omission - effect size may be omitted for the sake of interest - eg, "increase life expectancy" but increase is only a month

Transparency in statistics is important - being open and honest about data is important
