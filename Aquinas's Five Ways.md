[[Aquinas - Critical Evaluation]]

### 1. Argument from motion
All things need a mover to move
If there are infinite moving things, then there is no first mover, so nothing can have moved
There must be a first mover
The first mover is God
\*not literal movement, motion is umbrella term for all change/properties\*
#### [[Cosmological]]

**Formalization:**
P1: Things are in motion(change) - potentiality to actuality
- Phenomenon
P2: Nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality except by something in a state of actuality (condition 1)
P3: It's not possible for the same thing to be both actual and potential in the same way at the same time (condition 2)
C1: Therefore, whatever is put in motion is put in motion by another
P4: But, this creates a chain of dependence
P5: This chain can't go on to infinity because then there would be no first mover and no subsequent movers
C2: Therefore, it's necessary to arrive at a first mover, and this is God

### 2. Nature of the efficient cause
Nothing is the efficient cause of itself
There cannot be infinite efficient causes, because a cause requires itself to be preceding an effect, and so if there is no first cause is no first effect, no second cause, no second effect, etc
There must be a first cause, God
#### [[Cosmological]]

**Formalization:**
P1: There is an order of efficient causes
P2: For a thing to be its own cause, it would have to exist prior to itself (cond 1)
P2: But this is impossible (cond 2)
C1: Therefore, a thing cannot cause itself
P4: The first causes the intermediate, which then causes subsequent effects (cond 3)
P5: Taking away the cause takes away its effect (cond 4)
P6: If we assumed an infinite chain of causation, then there would be no first cause and no subsequent causes
C2: Therefore, it is necessary to arrive at a first cause, and this is God
### 3. Possibility and necessity
Everything can be or not be, but can't be and not be at the same time
If there was every nothing, then there could never be anything
Some being had to exist from the beginning of its own necessity and cause the necessity of everything else
This is God


### 4. Gradation
We grade something relative to its position to the highest form of that genus - eg, we call something "hotter" because we know how hot "hottest" is
The things that are the greatest in truth are the greatest in being
The maximum in any genus is the cause of everything in the genus - eg, fire is the maximum of heat
There must be something that is the cause of all being and perfection
This cause is God
### 5. Governance of the world
Things that lack intelligence act towards an end always/nearly always in the same way
Whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end unless it is directed by some being with knowledge and intelligence
Some intelligence being exists that directs all natural things
This being is God
#### [[Teleological]]

**Formalization**
P1: Natural beings without a mind nearly always work towards best result
P2: This means that they are working towards an end
P3: Whatever lacks cognition cannot move towards an end unless directed by some being with intelligence
C: Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed towards their goal, and this is God
