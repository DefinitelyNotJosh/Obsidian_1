## When taking notes, draw connections by:
- Linking to other notes
- Write conceptually, there are no "disciplines," everything is linked
	- Build off of old concepts
	- The teacher is telling a story, write down concepts
- #### Keep track of U S E during a lecture:
	- Unimportant
	- Self Explanatory
	- Easy Enough to Memorize
If a concept doesn't fit USE, put it down

- Don't write down examples - instead, predict how the instructor will do the problem, and write when your own thought process deviates from the instructor
	- Will highlight what you're more likely to be tripped up on in the future 

- ### Don't bunch information together - make everything as atomic as possible
	- Conceptually, not sequentially
