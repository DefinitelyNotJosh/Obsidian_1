### SECTION 1

Prompt 1 | What does the existence of the different portrayals of Jesus in the New Testament and non-canonical (gnostic) texts reveal about the nature of early Christian communities and the development of Christianity? What do you think is the most significant takeaway of our study of Jesus in early Christian gospels for how we view Christianity today?

- Establishment of an orthodox set of beliefs wasn't totally clear for all churches from the start
	- Gnostics - Jesus was path to gnosis/salvation, incarnated God - "he performed miracles and great wonders for the salvation of humanity" (Coptic Gospel of Judas)
		- Purpose is familiar, but theology much different - "<You> are not doing this because of your own will but because it is through this  that your god [will be] praised" (Coptic Gospel of Judas) - "'Master, you are ... the son of our god.' Jesus said to them, 'How do you know me? Truly [I] say to you, no generation of the people that are among you will know me.'" (Coptic Gospel of Judas)
			- Deemed heretical once orthodoxy established
	- Jewish Christians - stuck to some tradition, recognized Jesus (specifically) as Jewish Messiah (Matthew)
	- Former pagans - integrated some culture, recognized Jesus as God, savior to all (Luke)

- Most important thing: Jesus' words are preserved well
	- Well agreed that Gospels are eyewitness accounts
	- Manuscript evidence - shows what we have today is accurate
	- Bible is a historically reliable account of the words of Jesus
	- Common misconception: Bible "translated over and over"


Prompt 2 | What can Paul’s letters tell us about the complexity and diversity of beliefs and practices in early Christian communities? What do you think are the most significant things to know about Paul, his letters, and their impact on our world today, and why?

- Early churches came from diff cultures
	- Like mentioned, some pagan, some Jewish
	- Paul corrected what he considered "bad"
- Various persecution/wealth
	- Corinthians in wealthy Greek city, not as persecuted, off course - "Each one of you says , 'I follow Paul,' or 'I follow Cephas,' or 'I follow Christ.' Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?" (1 Corinthians 1:12-13)
		- Pagan
	- Thessalonians much more in line - "We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you." (1 Thessalonians 1:2-4)
		- Jewish
	- Galatians went off the rails, so Paul does the same - "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel - not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ." (Galatians 1:6-8)
		- Mostly pagan
- Different practices influenced by previous cultural norms

- Most important thing, gospel message:
	- Were unified by Paul's letters
		- Saved by grace
	- Not enough teaching on salvation by grace
		- Kids being scared by the rapture is a consequence of this
		- Many people don't know salvation is by grace, have incorrect view of Christian doctrine

Prompt 5 | In Dark’s Everyday Apocalypse, he challenges the popular definition of apocalypse. By engaging with Dark’s work, what do you think it means to live apocalyptically in today’s world (even outside of the Christian tradition), and if so, what might that entail? What artist(s) do you find most apocalyptic and why?

- Living apocalyptically - living in a state of enlightenment, having things revealed to you - "apocalyptic is the place where the future pushes into the present. It's the breaking in of another dimension, a new wine for which our old wineskins are unprepared." (Dark, 12)
	- Jesus, "know\[ing\] all things" (John 16:30), lived the most apocalyptically out of anyone ever - he created everything, apocalyptic is knowing "there isn't a secular molecule in the universe" (Dark 12), and "All things were made through [Jesus], and without him was not any thing made that was made" (John 1:3 )
- Live in a way that values pursuing truth
	- Necessity for it - reject subjectivism, gain understanding that truth exists
- Specifically for Christianity - for all denominations that view Bible as God-inspired/infallible:
	- Don't twist scripture for your own benefit - try to understand it in context and as intended
		- Don't misinterpret because it preaches well - How dare you do that?
- Christian content creator/pastor I find most apocalyptic - Mike Winger
	- Tries to be faithful to text, acknowledges when he misrepresents passages, allows himself to be persuaded by new arguments

- The Roman Trajan and Pliny letters - early Christians who jumped ship when questioned abt it
