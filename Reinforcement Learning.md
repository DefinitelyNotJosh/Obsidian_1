Reinforce rewards, arguably the route to "true" intelligence

Start with total random exploration, once patterns are found feed into them - mimics ants in nature
- maximize reward

#### RL inspiration
- Thorndike: The law of Effect
- Chris Walkings: Q learning
- Minimize behavior (Bellman)

#### RL application
- Game theory
- info theory
- robotics
- swarm intelligence
- genetic algos
- etc
