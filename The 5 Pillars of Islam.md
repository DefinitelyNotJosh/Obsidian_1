The Prophet describes 5 things in a Hadith that describes what Islam is to a stranger, turns out the stranger is Gabriel, and he gives Muhammad 5 stars

### 1. Profession of Faith (Shahada)
There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet
- Normally done in the presence of 2+ other witnesses, akin to baptism

### 2. Prayer or Worship (Salat)
Praying 5 times a day - can be done at home, at a mosque, personally or collectively, etcetera

Players led by an Imam - however, it is not like a Catholic priest, there's no clergy or institutional hierarchy in Islam
- Leads to some problems of authority

The giving of 2.5% of your assets
