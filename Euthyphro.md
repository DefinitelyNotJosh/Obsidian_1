### An Athenian religious prophet
	Regarded as a wise person who taught morality and politics - also told prophecies

##### Worshipped the pagan gods of Ancient Greece, ie [[Zeus]] and co.

### Written by [[Plato]]



1. What are the definitions proposed by Euthyphro?
2. How effective is the [[Socratic Method]]? Is it beneficial to the interlocutor/conversational partner?


#### Background - Euthyphro meets [[Socrates]] near the king-archon's court
- [[Socrates]] is there because [[Meletus]] was charging him for corrupting the young and not believing in the gods 
- Euthyphro is there prosecuting his father who killed a laborer who was a murderer

##### The dialogue is a search for a def of [[Piety]]
- no def is found that [[Socrates]] is ok with


#### Is it wrong to not prosecute a loved one when they commit an unjust murder, even against a murderer?
- ##### Euthyphro thinks so
- Akins being in the company of a murderer with "pollution"
	- Sees it as the polluting/dirtying of one's soul, possibly inhibiting them from entering [[Elysium]] and instead be sent to [[Hades]]
	- could also be linked to the idea of one becoming the sum of their closest friends

##### Euthyphro's father threw the man in a ditch after he murdered one of their household slaves
- while waiting for an answer from a priest on what he should do with the killer, the killer died from the cold and hunger

###### Euthyphro compares his situation to the story of [[Zeus]] and [[Kronos]], arguing that just as Kronos unjustly swallowed his sons and Zeus punished him, he was also punishing his father for unjustly killing a man

#### Is Euthyphro doing the right thing?
- ##### Personally, I think yes. He is allowing the current justice system made up of Athenian citizens to decide whether his father is guilty or innocent, and is not calling for the death or imprisonment for his father
	- If anything, with so many people appalled with Euthyphro's decision, there's a good chance his father will go free



### Euthyphro's first definition of [[Piety]]
- #### To prosecute the wrongdoer
##### Defense: This is what the Gods do

##### [[Socrates]] doesn't accept this definition because this is only one act of [[Piety]], and it fails the [[Generality Requirement]]
- Definition does NOT apply to all pious acts


### Euthyphro's second definition of [[Piety]]
- ##### "What is dear to the gods is pious, what is not is impious"

##### Passes the [[Generality Requirement]]
##### Fails the [[Coherence Requirement]]

[[Socrates]] counters that as they already established, the gods are constantly in a state of discord and are at odds with each other
- as such, the different gods consider different things to be just, beautiful, ugly, good, and bad
- leads to contradiction

Euthyphro claims that all the gods would support his decision, since he is bringing a wrongdoer to justice

[[Socrates]] asks for justification




### Euthyphro's third definition of [[Piety]]
- ##### "The pious is what all the gods love, and the opposite, what all the gods hate, is impious"
	- ##### What some gods love and others hate is neither

##### Passes the [[Generality Requirement]]
##### Passes the [[Coherence Requirement]]
##### Fails the [[Essence Requirement]]
- We don't know the virtue of what an act is pious

[[Socrates]] drops the question: "Is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is being loved by the gods?"
- Euthyphro: an act is loved by the gods because it's pious
- They later come to the conclusion that the god-loved and pious are not the same

#### [[The Euthyphro Dilemma]]


#### "Where there is fear there is also shame"
- ##### [[Socrates]] disagrees with this statement
	- argues that although there is shame where there is fear, fear covers a much broader area than shame 
		- eg, people fear disease and poverty, and they are not ashamed of their fear


#### The godly and pious - Euthyphro
- ##### "The part of the just that is concerned with the care of the gods, while that concerned with the care of men is the remaining part of justice"


### Euthyphro's fourth definition of [[Piety]]
- #### A knowledge of how to sacrifice and pray
	- [[Socrates]] inquires further, brings it down to a knowledge of how to give to, and beg from, the gods

Euthyphro ends up circling back to the pious being what is dear to the gods, even though both he and [[Socrates]] agreed that they were different earlier in the conversation
