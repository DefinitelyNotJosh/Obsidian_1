### OUTLINE
Prompt 1: 
Ways authors challenged commonly-held assumptions about reading texts
- Texts portray an idea - authors disagree, think infinite meanings - “What the academic community today decides counts as a reasonable interpretation of Psalm 24 _is_ a reasonable interpretation, and until my community decides that my interpretation is acceptable, it _isn’t_ acceptable” (179, Clines).
- There is a "Biblical" view of something, particularly womanhood - Evans, Sword Drills - Challenged interpretation of 1 Timothy 2:11 by assuming Paul was biased - “\[omitted women witnessing Jesus’ resurrection\] from his account for fear of sounding unreliable” (190, Evans) + taking a feminist reading. 

Two points from class I find noteworthy
- Reading with the grain vs against the grain - there's nuance in almost every situation we call "evil," helps understand motive and have empathy.
- Inexhaustible meanings of text - Noteworthy, but not in good way
	- Very dangerous - if this is case, have to acknowledge Jim Jones' interpretation that led to the mass suicide of over 900 people was a "valid interpretation" of scripture
	- Interpret laws in ways that allow for tyranny

How I'll utilize these ideas in my own study/career -
- Building software
- given a roadmap, have to read against the grain to catch possible bugs/vulnerabilities before they appear. Client's ideas may be bad, have to let them know if they are
- When client has criteria, have to find what they're asking - can't interpret it any way I please and expect it to be ok. No "inexhaustible meanings" to "use the React framework for the frontend"

Prompt 2:
Compare/contrast the portrayal of relationships in 1+ mesopotamian text and 2 biblical texts
Relationship with the divine
- Atrahasis - no objective evil, humanity a nuisance - "After six hundred years the people became too numerous, and “the country was as noisy as a bellowing bull."" (33, Collins)
- Noah - objective moral evil punished, "The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." (Genesis 6:5)
- Pharaoh punished for evil, enslaving Israelites
- Atrahasis - humanity to bear burdens of the gods, Bible - humanity created to bring pleasure to God 

In what ways can you use biblical texts to address current societal issues?
- The US enforcing "order" in the world
- People have different understandings of morality - I believe in objective morality, doesn't mean everyone else does, I have a moral system, doesn't mean everyone has the same system - understand that
	- Judeao-Christian morality isn't a default, make morals known
	- Even Jesus didn't hold ignorance against people - Jesus said not to hold the blind guilty - "If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains" (John 9:41).
- Doesn't mean shouldn't act morally upright

Reflect on the biblical texts and their interpretations that you find most relevant/insightful for understanding relationships
- Interpretation - God reserves the right to remove evil, and if God is all good, if God does it, it's for the greater good
- Humanity's relationship with God: God reserves right to judge evil, God not evil for it
- My relationship with God: God does something that I think is evil/hurts me? I'm wrong and ignorant

Prompt 3:
In the spirit of Clines' approach, provide an assessment of Psalm 24's ideology - DONT TALK ABOUT CLINES
-  World established on water - "And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters"" (Genesis 1:6).
- Those who will ascend hill of the Lord: people not being prevented from doing so by God, instead *only* people who have clean hands/pure hearts will genuinely climb the hill of the Lord
- God mighty in battle - Saying God is mighty in battle and that God is glorious does not give green flag to war

Craft a response to Clines' question, "Who for me is the king of glory?", particularly how to interpret "the entry of the king of glory through the ancient gates". Think about "inexhaustible meanings of the text"
- King of glory: 1. Am Christian 2. Believe Scripture is divinely inspired - God is the King of Glory. Father, Son, Holy Spirit
- Entry of the King of Glory through ancient gates: Jesus entering Jerusalem before his crucifixion - Christ's second coming: Will enter Jerusalem again, and rule from it.
