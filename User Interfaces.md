### Designing effective interfaces
- General design principles
- Wireframes
- Prototypes (interactive wireframes)
	- Try to put all accessibility/general settings in one place, and have 3-4 layers MAX
- Usability

#### User Interface:
- System users often judge a system by its interface, rather than its functionality
- A poorly designed interface can cause a user to make catastrophic errors
- Poor user interface design is the reason why so many software systems are never used
- UI types:
	- GUI - icons, menus, pointing devices, touch, graphics...
	- Text-based User Interface - Are they still used
	- Virtual Reality...

#### UI Design Principles
- Should take into account needs, capabilities, experience of the user
- Recognize that people make mistakes - try not to punish users/have warnings

### Golden rules:
#### Place the user in control
- Design interaction modes in a way that doesn't cause a user to do unnecessary/undesired actions
- Provide for flexible interaction
- Allow user interaction to be interruptible and reversible - able to go back and forth in UI
- Streamline interaction as skill levels advance, allow interaction to be customized
- Hide technical internals from the casual user
- Design for direct interaction with objects that appear on the screen
In a nutshell, simple, abstract, intuitive

#### Reduce the user's memory load
- Reduce demand on short-term memory - reduce requirements to remember past actions, provide visual cues
- Establish meaningful defaults - establish defaults that make sense to the average user, but allow changes to defaults - allow easy reset to default
- Define intuitive shortcuts
- Visual layout of interface should be basically a real world metaphor - should contain well-understood visual cues that the user can relate to real-world actions - eg, notepad for notes
- Don't information dump, interface behavior should be organized hierarchically - the more a user has to remember, the more error-prone the system will be
#### Make the interface consistent
- Should present and acquire information in a consistent fashion
- Allow the user to put the current task into a meaningful context
