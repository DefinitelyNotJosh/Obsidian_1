of a discrete random variable is the probability that for any number $x$, the observed value of the random variable will be at most $x$ or $p(X \geq x)$. 
- ex. - when a fair die is rolled and the value facing up is recorded, CDF describes the probability of getting less than or equal to any value $x$, such that the probability $X$ is less than or equal to 3
	- $F(3)=p(X \geq 3)=\frac{1}{2}$ is read as: "the probability $X$ is greater than or equal to 3 is one half"
	- $p(X  \geq 6) = 1$, as the probability of the number being greater than or equal to 6 is 100%
	- Notation $F(x)$ is typically used for the CDF of X
	- CDF always starts at 0 and ends at 1, never decreases as the value of X increases
