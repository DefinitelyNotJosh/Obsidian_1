[Can Christians Be Possessed By Demons?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpd-kFzgrhE&t=172s)

1:57 - "It doesn't matter if you speak in tongues 300 miles per hour"
- You cannot partake in the actions of the spirit and the actions of evil at the same time. Cannot serve two masters. Inadvertently arguing against the modern gift of tongues as a genuine spiritual gift if you suggest one can be both "in the spirit"(speaking in tongues) and make way for demons.

2:07 - "Galatians 5:1"
- Gross defiling of scripture. Context of Galatians is incredibly clear that the yoke of bondage is the law. Clear as day example of reading biases into scripture. Stop doing eisegesis, demons not related at all to the passage.

2:38 - "Acts 5:3, Satan can 'fill' Christians" 
- Only thing this verse proves is demonic influence. Does not prove Vlad's theology. The word 'heart' carries a lot of weight, as it is a picture of the flesh sometimes, and at other times it's the center of one's spiritual life. The use of the word in Ephesians 5:18 does not say for the spirit to fill the heart. The word "heart" can make a huge difference in what this passage means. Compare apples to apples. Look where *kardia*(heart) is used in conjunction with *plēroō*(filled)
- John 16:6, Jesus tells the disciples that sorrow has FILLED their HEART, but he corrects them by saying it's better for him to leave so he can send down the Holy Spirit. When the "filling of the heart" is spoken of, it is being used in reference to our fleshly wants and desires. This is the only verse with both *kardia* and *plēroō* being used together.

3:37 - "Matthew 13:19, which was sown in his heart"
- The person in the example didn't understand the word. You cannot call them a Christian. I don't even know why he brought up this verse.
- Defilement of scripture. Look in the CONTEXT of what is meant by HEART. It can either mean the center of someone's spiritual life or the essence of their depravity depending on the context. Clearly here it is meant as the former. I believe I showed before that in Acts 5:3 it is being used as the latter. This isn't an apples to apples comparison. 

4:04 - "Luke 22:3, Satan "Entered" Judas"
- Pentecost had not happened. The permanent indwelling of the Holy Spirit hadn't come to fruition. The argument against Vlad is that those indwelt with the Spirit cannot have demons within them. The disciples were given authority by Jesus to do certain things by the spirit, but it is never said that it would be dwelling within them. This does not support Vlad.
- Judas' pre-salvation is a very hotly debated topic. We don't have a definitive answer. Getting authority by Jesus to do certain things by the Holy Spirit isn't the same as having the Holy Spirit dwell within you. His "lets be real here" presumes his premise about demons dwelling within Christians is correct and then tries to appeals to Christians' natural desire to be humble before Christ, while not strengthening his argument.

5:10 - "Matthew 16:23, Jesus confronted Satan in Peter"
- Again, does not help Vlad's argument. Does not in any way confirm that demons can be within a believer, as we know that Satan can influence the thoughts of believers + Pentecost hadn't happened yet, no indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Vlad adds the word "in" to try and make his case. Another case of scripture defilement.

5:40 - "Acts 8:13, Simon the Sorcerer"
- Does not support Vlad's point. 8:22 is very clear, Peter says repent of this wickedness of YOURS, so the intention of the heart may be forgiven, and nowhere is it mentioned that any demon or spiritual power is at work. This is not deliverance ministry. Peter does not tell Simon to bind a demon, he tells him to repent of HIS wickedness and the intention of HIS heart. 

6:26 - "Luke 13:10-17, Jewish woman with spirit of infirmity"
- Nowhere does the Abrahamic covenant mention anything about protection from evil spirits. If God did do it, it was a result of his mercy working outside of the covenant, so the "daughter of Abraham" argument falls flat

Modern more accurate translations mark it as "opportunity," not the "place" definition Vlad's theology is so dependent on
