funcName :: Type
funcName param_1 param_2 ... param_n = expression
```
All functions have this form

Expressions: 
- Lots of different types of expressions - assignment expressions, if expressions, case expressions
- These are NOT statements

#### Lambda
- A lambda expression has the form - `\x -> e`
- Fundamentally everything a lambda
- Can be used as event handlers
- Haskell based on the Lambda Calculus
- Supports type inference 
- Often used with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions

``` 
lambda x: x * 2
```

Everything that can be done with a turing machine can be done with lambda calculus and vise versa

Alonzo Church in the 1930's asked the question what is a function - answer - takes an input and gives back an output

#### New notation for functions: $$\lambda x.e$$ this is a function that takes a variable called and returns an e
