### The Study of knowledge, branch of [[Philosophy]]

What does it take to know something? How much evidence to you need to declare something to be true?

Upper branch of [[Social Epistemology]]

### 3 Types of Knowledge
#### 1. Knowledge how - how to do things
#### 2. Knowledge by acquaintance - e.g., knowing the surroundings of an area or a friend through familiarity
#### 3. Propositional knowledge - knowledge of propositions/statements, knowledge "that," e.g. 2 + 2 = 4, capital of Oregon is Salem
- Philosophers are encapsulated by it because it's knowledge of "true facts," expresses relation to truth
##### Standards for propositional knowledge:
A subject S knows proposition P
if and only if(iff): 
- S believes that P
- P is true
- S' belief that P must be justified
##### ^^Justification, Truth, Belief model for knowledge

Do we have to eliminate all possible doubt to qualify of knowing something?
Raising standard of knowledge very high brings [[Skepticism]] - we then don't know very much
