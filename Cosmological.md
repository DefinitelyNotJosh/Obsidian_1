### Observation of cosmos/universe --> God exists as first cause/starting point

#### [[A Posteriori]]
- observations/experience

#### Criticisms against [[Aquinas]]' cosmological argument, [[Aquinas's Five Ways]]
1. Doesn't prove existence of omnipotent, omniscient, all good God
	1. Only 1st cause/1st mover, could be used to prove multiple gods/big bang
2. Uncaused/spontaneous event
	1. Genetic mutations(?)
	2. Maybe universe was a spontaneus uncaused event

3. Why deny an infinite past?
	1. Infinite future agreed on
		1. Infinite past hard to conceive
			1. Is an infinite past easier to conceive of than a God?
			2. Counter: Energy has infinite existence
