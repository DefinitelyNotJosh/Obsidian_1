## Probability of $\beta$ for [[Z-Test]]

#### Where $\delta=\mu_{true}-\mu_0$
### Two tailed test: $$\beta=\phi \left(z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)-\phi\left(-z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)$$
· The symbol Φ is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) probability associated with the value inside of the parenthesis. The value for the probability can be obtained in the z-table. A simplistic way of interpreting this is thinking of it like the probability associated with a z value, where the result of the equation inside of the parenthesis is the z value.

· −𝑧$_{\alpha/2}$ in the second term of the equation represent a true negative z value. Regardless of the sign when calculating the test statistic z value, the sign will always be negative when used in this term of the equation. It is also the z value associated with ½ of the α. Example,

when α =0.05, then α/2 = 0.025.

### Left Tailed test: $$beta=1-\phi \left(z_{\alpha}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)$$
### Right  Tailed test: $$beta=\phi \left(z_{\alpha}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)-0$$
