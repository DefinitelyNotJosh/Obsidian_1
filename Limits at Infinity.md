### What happens as x -> inf or x -> -inf
- #### The end behavior

#### Ex. f(x) = 1/x    lim 1/x = 0
                               x -> inf

Any small additions are trivial, and as such are not necessary for finding the limit
 - (4x^2-8)/-7x^2 has the same limit at +inf as 4x^2/-7x^2


#### Sine functions don't have limits because they don't hone on one single point 

#### Take the numerator and denominator with the highest degree in the function which limit you are trying to find, will have same limits
- ###### Ex.  lim    (5x^7-3x^2+2)/(4x^6-5x+7)   =   5x^7/4x^6     =    5/4x =    DNE
      x -> inf
