### Yancy is a professor of philosophy at Emory University
### Piece was written in response to them being identified as peddling left-wing extremist values by Turning Point USA


### Compares the Professor Watchlist to something out of [[George Orewell]]'s [[1984]]
- There is no campaign to eliminate Yancy's freedom of speech
- Nothing Yancy says is misrepresented by the site
- It doesn't call him dangerous - it says on the front page - "The mission of Professor Watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom."
	- Not a call to violence
		- One could view it as an act of defiance from the other side who experienced persecution from the professors
- As such, the situation appears to be an [[Intentional Fallacy]]


#### [[Strawman Fallacy]](ies) the "Make America Great Again" statement, saying it signifies going into a racial dystopia, when that was never a goal of the campaign


#### He seems to hold some questionable views that generalize all white people
- "If you are white, and you are reading this letter, I ask that you don’t run to seek shelter from your own racism. Don’t hide from your responsibility. Rather, begin, right now, to practice being vulnerable. Being neither a “good” white person nor a liberal white person will get you off the proverbial hook. I consider myself to be a decent human being. Yet, I’m sexist. Take another deep breath... After all, it is painful to let go of your “white innocence,” to use this letter as a mirror, one that refuses to show you what you want to see, one that demands that you look at the lies that you tell yourself so that you don’t feel the weight of responsibility for those who live under the yoke of whiteness, your whiteness." - NYT, "Dear White America"
	- Doesn't matter what the situation is, eliminating agency and blaming an entire group for the actions of individuals is immoral


Claims to have acts of racial injustice committed against him, e.g. getting pulled over by a white officer just for being black, but offers no evidence for his claims - [[Anecdotal Fallacy]], [[Affective Fallacy]]

- His goal is to "gift" his students an ideology that will leave them "maladjusted and profoundly unhappy with the world as it is"
	- [[Socrates]]' goal was figuring out how to live a moral and good life - and he didn't charge people for listening to him


Yancy claims that Turning Point America seeks to flag his content as un-American and leftist propaganda, when that is never stated
- His professor profile one of the shortest on the site by far
- Only addresses his own very morally questionable article, "Dear White America" that labels all white people as racist, which is an [[Association Fallacy]]
- 

##### Even [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], when addressing the white lukewarm Christians, didn't accuse his brethren of racism
- Yancy quotes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Socrates]] as if they would agree on his position - With what we know, neither of them would support Nancy's goals, e.g. transgenderism


#### Aligns his own situation with other much more egregious moral nightmares, including:
- Child sex trafficking
- Mass murder
- Calling the disabled "monstrous"
^His situation is not on par with those above, it is a [[False Equivalence Fallacy]] and intellectually dishonest in its attempt to garner support by referring to situations that no sane person would support and attaching them to his position that maybe half the US population supports
- All the above situations are serious and deserve to be addressed separately
