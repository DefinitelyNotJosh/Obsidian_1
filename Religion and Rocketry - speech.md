Essay: Religion and Rocketry by CS Lewis
Theological implications of encountering alien life

CS Lewis
- British guy
- Christian author
- Veteran
- Known for Mere Christianity or his Chronicles of Narnia series
- Died in 1963

Spoiler alert, CS Lewis doesn't think Christianity will be effected by the discovery of alien life, just as it wasn't really effected by Darwinism, modern astronomy, or modern psychology. Instead, the smart people will debate for a while, and end up in pretty much the same place as they were in before. The discovery can neither entirely prove or entirely disprove secularism or Christianity. 

Throughout the essay, CS Lewis touches on some cool key concepts.

The first is about Aliens and their spirituality.
CS Lewis thinks that on this front, animals or plants wouldn't matter. What matters is whether or not a species can understand what is "good". Not good as in good for the individual or good for the species, but objective good from a moral standpoint.

The second is, assuming they're real, the consequences of an alien race being fallen or not fallen
"Fallen" is a Christianese term to describe Humanity's condition of sin - we were perfect when we were created, but when sin was introduced, we "fell". Assuming that the alien races were made by God, they were probably originally created perfect too. However, whether or not they succumbed to sin is unknown.

If an alien race is fallen, there might be a different remedy for their sin condition provided by God. After all, who's to say our fallenness is on the same caliber? There's also the possibility that all the alien races could be saved through the human Jesus. If this were the case, Lewis makes it clear that it wouldn't make humanity special - Jesus was born in a manger in Bethlehem, after all, and we don't see any preferential treatment towards those folk. Moving on, what would it be like if we came into contact with a fallen race? CS Lewis thinks that, at least on first contact, one side will destroy the other. I personally have a little more faith in humanity than he does, but I can't speak on behalf of a hypothetical alien race.

If the alien race isn't fallen, then in an ideal world, we would peacefully exchange thoughts and ideas. Regardless of who is smarter, we would connect, learn, and help each other. But, this probably won't be the case. If we encounter an unfallen race, the sad truth is that we'd probably exploit their innocence and then feel bad about it later - just like we've done to so many others on earth - and then pathetically try to make up for it.

Lat idea: What comes first: Christianity or humanity? If aliens become Christians or are unfallen but humanity decides to exploit or imperialize them, what should we do? CS Lewis is pretty bold on this subject. He says that Christians should stand against all exploitation and all theological imperialism, and should never compromise. He thinks our loyalty to humanity shouldn't come close to our loyalty to brothers and sisters in Christ, and than even though we will probably fail, it's better to go down fighting for the right side.

Thanks for listening! 















### Animals and souls
- The ability to comprehend values
- Do they know what "good" is, and not "good" as in what benefits "me" or what benefits my species, but objective goodness
- Could be hard to tell - it's not impossible for aliens to be smart enough to talk, but not spiritual

### Alien Races and being "fallen"
- Christ didn't die because humanity is great - he died because humanity is awful and not worth dying for - Christ died so that we could be worth dying for
- if they aren't fallen, what if there's a different remedy to their condition? Would we be able to recognize a remedy if there was

### What happens if we meet other species?
##### In an ideal world: 
- we interchange thoughts and ideas
- if they're smarter than us or us them, we still connect with one another and help one another
##### We don't live in an ideal world.
Probable outcome:
- Look at examples of what humanity does to other species, or even other humans that happen to look slightly different
- People cheat, enslave, murder, and corrupt
- Some people don't, but the odds that those who don't are the ones who are risking their lives in space? They're low. More likely greedy adventurers and ruthless technical experts. 
- The explorers will subdue the alien race if they're weaker than us - if the aliens are stronger, they'll be wiped out
##### What if they were an "unfallen" race?
- We would exploit their innocence
- Good men would be racked with guilt
	- Afterwards, people would try to attempt to atone for their evil - maybe send missionaries


### What should our response be if we stand against exploitation and imperialism?
CS Lewis thinks we should stand against it
- We'll be called traitors to humanity
- Most people will hate us - and yet we shouldn't compromise a bit
- Loyalty is to God, not to our species - we should side with those who are the sons and daughters of God. They would be more our brothers and sisters than the humans who shun them
