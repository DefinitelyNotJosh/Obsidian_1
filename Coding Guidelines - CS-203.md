### Be consistent - however you choose to format, be consistent
### 1. Meaningful variable names - no one letter variables (with some exceptions)
### 2. Commenting - get into the habit of commenting while coding, type the comment before the code
- #### header on files
- #### header on methods
- #### in-line comment on the tricky bits
### 3. Indentation and whitespace - put braces in the right place
### 4. Named constants - All uppercase with underscore between words, ex public static final int WIN_WIDTH
- #### Named constants so you can make constants different
