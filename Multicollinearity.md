Occurs when 2+ predictors in multiple regression model are so highly correlated the estimated model becomes unstable (regression parameter estimates become unreliable with inflated standard errors)
- If perfect multicollinearity is present in a dataset, least squares method fails and software used to perform the regression will probably crash
If predictor variables are not perfectly multicollinear but still highly correlated but still highly corelated, estimates for corresponding regression parameters will be unreliable and sensitive
