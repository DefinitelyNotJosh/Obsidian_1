#### Generative model:
creates data
- Can be described as a Gaussian

### Two perspectives:
#### Frequentism
You can count discretely - each individual step has it's own probability - a snapshot
#### Probabilistic Belief
Probability compounds, depends on previous actions

#### [[Bayesian Learning]]

#### Discriminant and Generative models
