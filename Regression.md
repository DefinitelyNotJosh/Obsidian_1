Statistical model
Relationship between 2+ variables
Estimate conditional expectation
- Avg value
- Necessary condition analysis
Model = target function $y = f(x,b)$
Use: Predicion, forecast, variable correction
Parametric vs non-parametric

#### What does it spit out?
Model
Prediction
Classificaion
Residue (error)
Variance
Correlation

#### Regression models:
- [[Linear Regression]]
- Polynomial
- Power Law
- Logarithmic
- Exponential
- Local Gaussian
- Logistic
- Gaussian


### Proportionally scales the error based on the size of the input that caused the error in the first place
