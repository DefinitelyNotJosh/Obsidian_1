#### Denoted by $\overline{X}$, distribution of sample means when taking random samples of the same size. 
#### The mean of the sample means, denoted by $\mu_{\overline{X}}$, is the population mean. That is, $\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu$.  It's also the case that $\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{{n}}}$, where $n$ is the sample size. If the population distribution is normal, the sampling distribution for the mean of a sample taken from that population is normal regardless of sample size


### [[Standard Error]]
### [[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]] - when sample size increases, distribution approximates [[Normal or Gaussian Distribution]]

#### Large sample size is needed for Normal Distribution to be true, $N \geq 30$ is the general rule

### To use the [[Z-Score]] test, we need the population standard deviation and population mean using the [[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]]. When we don't have the population standard deviation or an $n \geq 30$, we use the T-Test, [[T-Distribution - T-Test]] and [[T-Table]]
