### Started in the 8th Century
#### root of Sufi is "wool"

A reaction against the Umayyad dynasty, rejection of excessive amenities
- preferring a wool garment over the fancy silk garments


- Muhammad as model Sufi
- Law/duties alone insufficient, one needs an 'interior' path of asceticism/meditiation
- experiential in nature, involving a commitment to personal transformation
- Dhikr = meditative prayer
- Metaphor of romantic love to describe relationship with the divine

#### Some meditations seek to "empty yourself out," Sufism is the opposite - it's trying to "overflow" with the presence of God

#### [[Whirling Dervishes]]
