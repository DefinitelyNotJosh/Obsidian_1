### For any function f(t), we define the derivative at t=a, f'(a), f'(a), by f'(a)=lim(h->0) (f(a+h)-f(a))/h

### Instant rate of change
- Time interval gets infinitely smaller

#### The outputs of f'(x) measure slope of tangent line, [[Instantaneous velocity]]


### Take away for L2 Quiz - get common denominator, remember that if both the num and denom of the fraction are multiplied by h, they are pretty much equal to each other


### [[Power Rule]]
