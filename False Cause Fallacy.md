### One mistakenly argues that A is the cause of B because:
#### 1. A Precedes B:
	I wore my silk scarf the day before I got my promotion. So, I'm going to wear my silk scarf when I apply for the grant
#### 2. A frequently accompanies B
	Whenever I watch TV at home, all I see are reruns. I ought to start watching TV elsewhere.
#### 3. A is an oversimplified cause of B
#### 4. Gambler's fallacy
	Joey has lost to his friends at poker every weekend, he's sure to win this one!
