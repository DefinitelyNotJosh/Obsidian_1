[[Cartesian Dualism]] does not explain how mental states cause changes in body and behavior

Why not?
#### 1. Argument from physical causation
1. States that have no physical properties(mass, charge momentum) cannot cause physical events or change physical states
2. But mental events do cause physical events(brain states, behaviors)
3. So, mental events cannot be nonphysical
4. Therefore, dualism is false

#### 2. Argument from physical determinism
All physical events are fully explained and determined by other physical events
- If you accept this premise, it stands that you must accept the Cosmological and second Argument from [[Aquinas's Five Ways]]

ex: Physical states will determine Harvey's arm movement
Harvey at T1 is not waving
Harvey at T2 is waving to a friend

What caused Harvey's arm to wave?
- muscle contractions from neural signals, entire process is physical

1. All physical events in the universe are fully determined and explained by previous physical events and laws of nature
2. This implies that if mental states were non-physical, they would be causally irrelevant
3. But mental events are causally significant
4. Therefore, mental states must be physical
5. Therefore, dualism is false

What if the brain is a tool that interprets the mind? 

**Should we accept physical determinism?**
- Fundamental assumption in modern science
- Standard scientific practice
