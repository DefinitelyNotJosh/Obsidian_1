"Do you know what a [[Nassi-Schneiderman Diagram (NSD)]] is? If not, why not? Do you know the difference between a [[Mealy State Machine]] and a [[Moore State Machine]]? You should. Could you write quicksort without looking it up? Do you know what the term “[[Transform Analysis]]” means? Could you perform a functional decomposition with Data Flow Diagrams? What does the term “[[Tramp Data]]” mean? Have you heard the term “[[Connascence]]”? What is a [[Parnas Table?]]"
- Clean Coder, p.17


"Here is a minimal list of the things that every software professional should be conversant with:

- Design patterns. You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books. 
- Design principles. You should know the SOLID principles and have a good understanding of the component principles.
- Methods. You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.
- Disciplines. You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Integration, and Pair Programming.
- Artifacts: You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.
