### [[Limits agree]]
### [[Functions divided over X]]


If a function f is continuous at c if lim f(x) = f(c), it means:
                                                    x -> c
Where the outputs are headed is where the outputs arrive 


#### For [[Continuous Functions]], plug in the limit into the equation and see what happens
- If the limit is 0/0, use algebra to plug the hole
- If the limit isn't 0/0 (ie 11/0) there is a [[Vertical Asymptote]] and the limit DNE(does not exist)


If a function is the form f(a) = K/0 where K is a constant, then lim f(x) DNE and has a [[Vertical Asymptote]]                                                                                 x -> a


If a function is of the [[Indeterminate Form]] f(a) = 0/0, then lim f(x) might have a hole, use algebra to plug the hole
