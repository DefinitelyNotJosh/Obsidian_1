### Involves the claim that it is improbable for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false

### Predictions, analogies, generalizations
#### - e.g, the ducks have won every game, so they will win next game in the season
#### - Jenna forgot to water the plants yesterday, so they will probably die
#### - The sign states that we have fifty miles to our destination. So, we have fifty miles to go

### Evaluation:

#### 1. Strength:
1. Strong: It is improbable for the conclusion to be false if we assume the truth of the premises
2. Weak: It is not improbable for the conclusion to be false if we assume the truth of the premises
Testing for strength:
- Assume premises are TRUE
	- In light of assumption, is the conclusion probably true?
		- If truth of conclusion more likely true, given true premises, then strong
			- else weak
#### 2. Cogency
1. Cogent: STRONG argument with TRUE premises
2. Uncogent: WEAK argument, at least one FALSE premise or both
