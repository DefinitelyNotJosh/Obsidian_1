An interval estimate constructed such that the probability the method produces an interval that contains the population parameter is given.
- Percentage of times the method produces a confidence interval containing the parameter is called a:
- #### confidence level, which is denoted by $c$
- Common $c$ values are 90%, 95%, 98%

Confidence intervals are constructed from the sample statistic and margin of error.
#### Margin of error
Denoted by $m$, measure of the estimate's precision and is constructed from a multiplier and the standard error of the statistic's sampling distribution. 
#### $$m=\text{(multiplier)(standard error)}$$

#### Multiplier
the multiplier, or critical value, for a c% confidence interval is the number of standard deviations about the mean of the sampling distribution that would capture c% of the distribution
#### $$\text{estimate }\pm m=\text{estimate }\pm \text{(multiplier)(standard error)}$$
Reminder - standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. The multiplier is the [[Z-Score]] or T-score associated with the c% confidence interval

#### [[T-Confidence Intervals - T-Test]]
