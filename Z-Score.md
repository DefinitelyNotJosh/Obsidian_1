Signed value, denotes how far a value is from the mean
#### $$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$ where $x$ is the raw score, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation


#### [[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]]

### For continuous problems, can solve using the standard normal distribution table, or the [[Z-Table]]
