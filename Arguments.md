### Branch of [[Logic]], a set of statements in which one is claimed to support the truth of another

#### Premise: Statements claimed to be the support
#### Conclusion Statement evidence is claimed support


#### An if-then statement is a conditional statement, and is NOT an argument

#### If there is no premises and only a claim, it is NOT an argument

### Distinguishing premises and Conclusion:
#### 1. Indicator words
	Conclusion: Therefore, this, consequently, as a result, entails that, hence, it follows that, for this reason
	Premise: Since, as indicated by, for the reason that, given that, because, for, may be inferred from
#### 2. Interpret arguer's intention
1. Identify conclusion - read passage, find what arguer is trying to prove
2. Identify premises - considerations offered to support conclusion?

#### Complications
- Premises, conclusion can appear anywhere in passage
- 1 sentence may have many statements
- Some statements not part of argument

#### Examples
- Since the defendant has a produced no alibi and had a clear motive, it is clear that she's guilty
	- Conclusion: defendant is guilty
	- Premise: no alibi and clear motive


#### [[Deductive Argument]]

#### [[Inductive Argument]]

#### How to distinguish:
1. Relationship between premises and conclusion
	1. If truth of premises guarantees truth of conclusion, deductive
	2. if truth of premises makes conclusion probable, inductive
2. Neither? Consider type of argument
	1. Based on math, logic, definitions - deductive
	2. Prediction, generalization, analogy - inductive


### [[Informal Fallacies]]


### Example

Every time Mr. Jones has taught contract law in the past, students have earned high marks on their exam. This semester, Mr. Jones is teaching contract law again. Therefore, we can expect his students to achieve high marks on the exam
	Inductive, strong


**All** English professors are articulate. Some articulate people are excessively critical. Therefore, **some** English professors are excessively critical.
	Deductive - Includes ALL and SOME, Invalid
