### g(x) = (4x^2-5x)/x

### Also an [[Indeterminate Form]]

#### Has a hole, or [[Removable Discontinuity]] at x=0

##### "Plug the hole" by cancelling X

g(x) has a hole @ x=0, domain restriction
g^^(x) =  4x-5 "plugs the hole"

	lim        g(x) = -5 
	x -> 0^+

	lim           g(x) = -5
	x -> 0^- 

### When the left and right limits both exist and are equal, we say the [[Limits (Calculus)]] exists: 
	lim       g(x) = -5
	x -> 0
