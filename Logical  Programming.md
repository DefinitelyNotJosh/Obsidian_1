### Boolean logic
This is && and || and !

mathematically using math symbols - $\land, \lor, \lnot$

"If it's raining then the sky is cloudy"
if it's raining $\rightarrow$ the sky is cloudy

"If the username is not in the database or the passwor doesn't match the username then I can't log in"

$\lnot$ username in database $\land$
...
### [[Declarative Programming]]

We give the computer logical constraints, it satisfies them


All math proofs have the form $A \land B \land ... \rightarrow P$
- Predicate in prolog
Flip it around in [[Prolog]]
