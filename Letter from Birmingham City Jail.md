### Written by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]


His fellow clergymen called his activities "unwise and untimely"
- MLK Jr disagrees
	- He didn't address criticism's often, because then he wouldn't have time to do anything else
	- He made an exception in this case, because the clergy was full of men that, to him, had genuine good will


### 4 Basic steps in a non-violent campaign:
#### 1. Collection of facts to determine if injustices exist
#### 2. Negotiation 
#### 3. Self purification
#### 4. Direct action
##### - Direct action comes if the unjust party refuses to negotiate
	- MLK's goal was to create a situation so crisis packed it open the door to negotiation
#### - Nonviolence demands that you must be pure as the ends you seek
	- Hence self purification


#### MLK Jr. references [[Socrates]]
- "Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood"


### "Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor, it must be demanded by the oppressed"
##### - In most cases true, some exceptions in early history, eg when groups converted into [[Christianity]]


#### King appeals to the emotion of the reader
- Telling your 16yo daughter they cant go to the new amusement park
- 5yo son asking why colored people are treated badly
- Not being able to sleep in motels
- First name becoming the n word, middle name John
- Women not being given their respective title of Mrs.


### Laws can be just or unjust
- King quotes [[St. Augustine]] - "an unjust law is no law at all"
- #### Just Law
	- man made code that is square w either moral law or law of God
- #### Unjust Law
	- code that is out of harmony with the moral law

St. Thomas Aquinas - An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law, any law that uplifts human personality is just, any law that degrades human personality is unjust

#### Sin is separation, and thus, by this reason and many others, segregation is sin


### King doesn't advocate for evading or defying law
- would lead to anarchy
##### King says an unjust law should be broken openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty - those that do this have the highest respect for the law
- References the biblical account of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego being thrown in the furnace for disobeying Nebuchadnezzar
- References the early Christians who faced unbelievable torment by refusing to obey unjust Roman law
- Reminds us that everything [[Adolf Hitler]] did was technically legal, and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was technically illegal


### King calls out the moderate Christian
- Says they are more devoted to order than to justice
	- Prefer a negative peace (no tension) over positive peace (justice)

"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."
- Has a good argument for his point in Christian doctrine, as the Bible does say God will spit out the lukewarm while John was addressing the church of Laodicea in Revelation 3:16

#### Condemning peaceful actions because they precipitate violence
- King points out that it's like condemning [[Socrates]] for his unwavering commitment to the truth

##### King is sure that if their white brothers dismiss him and his colleagues that employ nonviolent direct action as "rabble rousers" or "outside agitators" then millions of colored people would defect to black nationalist groups out of frustration
- As observed through history, if people are unable to express their thoughts of injustice nonviolently, they will turn to violence

### Extremism
- #### It's not a question of being extremist, it's what are you an extremist for?
	- Jesus was an extremist for love
	- Amos was an extremist for justice
	- Paul was an extremist for the Christian gospel
	- Martin Luther was an extremist, John Bunyan, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, etc
^All for their respective beliefs
