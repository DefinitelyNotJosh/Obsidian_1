### The speech that [[Socrates]] delivered in his own defense at his trial
	- There were 501 Athenians present at the trial
- #### Consists of 3 parts: main speech, counter-assessment, and last words to the jury
- #### He was 70 years old at the time of the trial, it was his first time in court



### Main Speech

### [[Meletus]]' accusation: Socrates corrupts the young and doesn't believe in the gods
- Socrates is apparently a [[Naturalist]], who tries to find natural explanations for things than explaining everything by putting a god behind it

#### [[Socrates]] starts of insisting that the people convicting him are stating lies 
- example one, they call him an accomplished speaker, and he claims he isn't, unless they meant "accomplished" as one who speaks the truth
- ##### The people over the years said he was a wise man who was student of all things in the sky and of the earth, who made weaker arguments stronger (convicting him of being a [[Sophists]]?)
-  Those people were, according to [[Socrates]], the most dangerous of his accusers, because they taught that the people who did such things didn't believe in the gods - they were also not big names and didn't step into the light; Socrates couldn't refute them or bring them to court. It was like "fight\[ing] with shadows."
	- Socrates does, however, acknowledge that [[Anytus]] is still formidable

He claims that he is not a person who holds the same wisdom as someone like [[Evenus]], and anybody who suggests such a thing speaks slander against him

 
#### [[Chaerephon]] went to Delphi and asked the oracle if anyone was wiser than [[Socrates]], and the [[Pythian]] replied no
- Only brought up so [[Socrates]] could argue that there is some riddle [[Apollo]] is playing, since he claims "I am very conscious that I am not wise at all"
- [[Socrates]] then goes on a journey trying to prove [[Apollo]] wrong
	- To his dismay, he realizes that the people who are professed to be wise by society are fools, in that they think they know what they don't, while [[Socrates]] doesn't think he knows what he doesn't
		- Finds out that the ones with the highest reputations were the most deficient, while the "inferior" people were more knowledgeable
			- Pointing this out in public made him unpopular
		- Anyone who was a master in his craft made the mistake of thinking being a master in one thing gave them knowledge in others

[[Socrates]] knows he doesn't know what he doesn't know

#### [[Socrates]]' argument: 
The young men following him imitate him and question the high reputation folk who think themselves to be wise
- Due to humiliation, they become angry with Socrates and claim he corrupted the young, when the only issue is their own ignorance that was brought into the light


#### [[Meletus]] is very clear on his position, and is unwilling to change it - he believes that [[Socrates]] alone is corrupting the young deliberately, and that every other Athenian citizen benefits the young
- [[Socrates]] points out that this is obviously a fantasy
- [[Meletus]] is only interested in bringing [[Socrates]] to death

##### [[Socrates]] argues that the court is a place of punishment, not of instruction, and because he is not there deliberately misleading the young, he has been unjustly prosecuted

###### [[Socrates]] argues that the things that he says can be learned from the books of [[Anaxagoras of Clazomenae]], and if [[Meletus]] has a problem with those theories, he should be prosecuting Anaxagoras

If [[Socrates]], as we established, believes in spiritual things, then: 
- He must believe in spirits
	- Spirits were believed to be gods or the children of the gods
		- Socrates believes in gods, and therefore, [[Meletus]]' charge is wrong

#### Fun [[Socrates]] point: fearing death is the same as thinking you are wise when you are not
- No one knows whether death could be the greatest blessing for man, and yet some men fear it as if they know it's the most evil thing

#### [[Socrates]] would rather die than be allowed to live under the condition that he could not practice philosophy again

##### "Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively"

[[Socrates]] never charged a fee for any of his philosophical talks

[[Socrates]] does care about his image and responsibilities, and since people consider him to be a superior man, he does not bring his family or break down into tears to gather pity from the jury
- He considers the act to be disgraceful


### Counter-Assessment
	Socrates was only acquited guilty by 30 votes, which surprised him - he thought it would be a one-sided decision

[[Socrates]] says he should get a consequence that is just for a man who didn't:
- cover himself with worldly possessions
- taught men to value their morality over their belongings 
- not value the city's possessions over the city itself 

He believes he should be fed free meals in the [[Prytaneum]] as his "punishment"


### Last words to the jury
	Socrates is sentenced to death

[[Socrates]] lets them know that they have to bear the guilt of killing a wise man, because even if he doesn't think himself to be wise, the people around him and across the world certainly did

[[Socrates]] says he would rather die after giving the defense that he did than live after giving a defense full of lamentations and tears
- "Neither I nor any other man should, on trial or in war, contrive to avoid death at any cost"

"It is not difficult to avoid death, gentlemen; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death"


[[Socrates]] prophecies that vengeance will come on the men who convicted him immediately after his death, a vengeance much harder than what they took in killing him


#### What could happen after death, according to [[Socrates]]
- Endless dreamless sleep
- Having your soul relocated to another world

Either way, [[Socrates]] doesn't have a problem with it







### Reasons [[Socrates]] was necessary and justified in his questioning
- Searching for truth, wisdom, virtue, and justice
- Improving Athenians
- Fulfilling his duty to the gods
- Teaching people humility and exposing their lack of knowledge



### Why might the critics think [[Socrates]] WAS guilty?
- Their presuppositions and lifetimes of hearing negative things about [[Socrates]] was too much to be overcome in one defense 
- Anyone who goes against the gods can be punished greatly, along with everyone around them - could be convicted out of precaution from the people
- Undermining their authority and weakening their power - disruptive behavior
- Untraditional ways of thinking that cause the youth to abandon cultural values
