The regression degrees of freedom is p — 1, where p is the number of regression parameters. Ex: Simple linear regression has p = 2 regression parameters, so the regression degrees of freedom is 1. * The regression mean square is the regression sum of squares divided by the regression degrees of freedom, M.SR = %.
