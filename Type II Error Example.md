- As it turns out, sample average 7906 ppm supported by the industry ([[Hypothesis Testing Examples]] Z-Test) claim that the benzene concentration in it's wastewater was less than 7980 ppm, with a significance less than a mandated alpha vale of 0.01 (p = 0.00172)
- Industry contends that this type II error in the testing protocol is too high

What is the probability that a random sample of 10 would fail to reject the null hypothesis? If this probability is too high, what can be done to improve the protocol?

Two-tailed test $$\beta=\phi \left(z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)-\phi\left(-z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)$$

 $$\beta=0.0132 \left(0.707-\frac{(7906-7980)\sqrt{10}}{80}\right)-\phi\left(-0.707-\frac{(7906-7980)\sqrt{10}}{80} \right)$$
