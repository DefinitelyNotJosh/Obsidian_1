### Part 1

#### Body swap experiment

Person A and B are thrown into a machine - A-body then get's B's mannerisms and memories, and B-body get's A's mannerisms and memories
- Machine - Brain swap or upload psych content

A is asked at the start of the experiment - one body gets $100k, the other gets tortured
- If A answers selfishly, which body will he pick?
- Likely he will pick body B

Seems to support [[Psychological Criterion of Personal Identity]]
- Self-oriented future concern is directed at the person who inherits one's psychological content

### Part 2

1. Tomorrow, you will be tortured 
2. Tortured, but 5 minutes before the torture, you forget the threat
3. Tortured, but 5 minutes before the torture, you get complete amnesia
4. Tortured, 5 minutes before complete amnesia, but you get new memories and character traits
5. Tortured, amnesia, memories and character traits modeled after Joe Biden
6. Tortured, amnesia - SWAP, all the content in your mind is uploaded into Joe Biden's brain, and vise versa 

#### William's Argument
**Formalization**
P1: We have no psychological connections with the future being in cases 5 and 6
P2: But we do have self-oriented concern for this being
C: Therefore, it is not psychological continuity, but bodily continuity that determines personal identity
