### Purpose or set of purposes in the universe --> God exists as an intelligent designer/architect

#### [[A Posteriori]]


#### Response to [[Aquinas]]' Teleogical Argument, way 5 of [[Aquinas's Five Ways]]
Purpose of Universe
- Intelligent Designer, God

1. Things that lack intelligence 
	1. Natural beings w/o a mind
2. move towards "Best Result" 
	1. Survival, flourishing
3. Only possible if there is an intelligent Designer

**Formalization**
1. Natural things without a mind/consciousness nearly always act towards the best result
2. Therefore, such things are always working towards a goal
3. Whatever lacks cognition cannot move towards a goal cannot move towards an end unless it be directed by some being with intelligence
4. Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed towards their goal, this is God

#### Criticisms against Aquinas' Teleological Argument
1. Best result?
	1. Organ failure, cancer
	2. Response: we don't know God's plan, it might be moving towards a best result
		1. Predator-prey relationships
2. Alternative Explanation
	1. Theory of Natural Selection: species without traits conducive to survival/reproduction die
	2. No need to posit God as intelligent designer
	3. Response: Maybe God implemented natural selection
		1. [[Principle of Parsimony - Ockham's Razer]]

#### Objection to teleological argument

P1: Accepting that God exists as the intelligent designer behind natural selection is more complicated than accepting natural selection alone, though both account for the phenomena
P2: The [[Principle of Parsimony - Ockham's Razer]] requires us to accept the simplest of competing theories
C: Therefore, we have good reason to accept natural selection alone - IF you accept natural selection as a premises
