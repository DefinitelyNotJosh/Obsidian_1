### X at time t1 is the same person as Y at time t2 just in case Y has experiential memories of X
- "just in case" = if and only if
- ##### Not just a factual memory, experiential memories only


### Advantages of Locke's Memory Criterion
1. Aligns with our intuitions
	1. Prioritizes psychological content
	2. Prince and the cobbler - he intuits that the prince woke up, not the cobbler
2. Experiential memories can only be had by the person who had the experiences


**Counterexamples:**
1. Memory, but no identity
2. Identity, but no memory 
	1. Memory lapses:
		1. injury
		2. degenerative disease
		3. intoxication
		4. ordinary memory loss due to age or irrelevance
	2. False memories


**Defending memory lapses:**
Different interpretation: Y is identical to X just in case Y can, under certain circumstances, remember X's experiences
- Prompts (hints, psychotherapy)

**Defending false memories:**
Distinction between apparent and genuine memories
Genuine memories require a specific kind of connection to past events
False memories do not exhibit this connection

**Problems remain**
Fails due to drunk driving scenario - A man may have no recollection at all of what happened to him while he crashed no matter what hints he may have - it doesn't change that he is responsible for it, and that he did the action.

1. Some memory gaps can't be bridged; memories irretrievable
2. What distinguishes genuine from apparent memories?
	1. 'Genuine' memory is one experienced by the same self -> using identity to define memory!


#### Violates the transitivity of identity:
identity is ''=''
**Transitive:**
A = B
B = C
-->
A = C

Locke's criterion makes: 
5 year old steals apples = 17 year old remembers
17 year old joins army  = 35 year old remembers
but 35 year old != 5 year old, because he does not remember stealing apples
