### Sameness: X at time T1 is the same as Y at time T2 just in case X and Y bear a substantive psychological relationship


**Persistence conditions:**
I could not survive unless my mind were preserved


Wat does 'substantive psychological relationship' consist in?
What does it mean to have my mind preserved
*Sufficient Psychological Continuity*
1. Mental contents: beliefs, desires, memories I have now arise from the content I had at a previous time
	1. Does NOT require:
		1. sameness of content
		2. Memories of past experience
		3. Intention to pursue past desires
2. Mental capacities: Feed myself, walk talk
	1. Requires the preservation of some content

#### Direct memory connections are not necessary, overlapping suffices

Psychological connections other than memory can establish identity: eg, values


### Intuitions favoring psychological criterion
**Persistent vegetative state**
- Intact: Brainstem, cerebellum (metabolism, digestion, circulation)
- Anoxia destroys cerebrum (consciousness, memory, reasoning)

**Transplant case**
- Cerebrum is transferred to another person's skull, but brainstem left intact in your body
- Other body (with your cerebrum) wakes up and thinks they are you, doesn't remember anything about person who received your cerebrum

**What do such cases show?**
**Two types of facts in these cases:**
1. Psychological facts: mental contents, capacities, memories
2. Life sustaining facts/biological facts
Most accept psychological continuity as determining factor in both cases
- Vegetative state -> Psychological discontinuity -> you don't survive
- Transplant case -> Psychological continuity -> you survive

**Parfit's Fission Case**
What if my psych content were transplanted into two people?
- Each 1/2 contributes equally to consciousness
- Quantity and quality of psychological states transferred is equal

What now? Did I survive? Who am I identical to?

What if the original doesn't survive?
1. I survived in ordinary transplant thought experiment
2. People have survived with 1/2 brain destroyed 

Original is identical to one of the two?
1. No! Each half received same psych content

Original is identical to both?
1. It is not possible to be identical to two things
2. You can't be in two places at once

Upshot: Psychological considerations may not always answer the question of identity
