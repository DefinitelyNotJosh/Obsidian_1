assigns the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value
- Notation $p(X=x)$ or $p(x)$ is typically used for the PMF of $X$
- Probabilities assigned in a PMF are between 0 and 1, and he total probability must sum to 1
- If in a histogram, it's the "mass" of each outcome relative to the total probability
