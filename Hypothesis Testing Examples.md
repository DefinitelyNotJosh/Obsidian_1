Question: Want to test a manufacturer's claim that their phone runs at least 28 hours

Null Hypothesis: The phone runs at least 28 hours a day

Alternative Hypothesis: the phone runs more than 28 hours a day (right tailed)


Question: Drug manuf. wants to determine if a new drug decreases blood pressure

Null Hypothesis: The average blood pressure doesn't change whether they take the drug or not

Alternative Hypothesis: Average blood pressure decreases (left-tailed)


 Test Statistic: t-statistic
 $t = \displaystyle\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$ and $df = n - 1$
 
 Calculate the p-value using t-table



#### Z-Test example
Benzene is a toxic chemical. A manufacturer claims that its wastewater meets the federal regulation w a mean concentration of 7980 ppm. 10 Random samples collected and are found to have an average of 7906 ppm. Assume the benzene concentration in plant wastewater have been normally distributed with a standard deviation of 80 ppm. Use a significance level of 0.01


Null Hypothesis: Wastewater benzene is 7980 ppm
Alternative Hypothesis: Wastewater benzene is less than 7980 ppm (left-tailed)
std dev - 80 ppm
n = 10
sample mean = 7980
$\mu$ = 7906


a) test manufacturer's claim
