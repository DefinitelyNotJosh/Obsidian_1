### An old friend of [[Socrates]], Story in *Five Dialogues* where Crito attempts to persuade Socrates to escape into exile
- #### Socrates refuses, and says why


### Crito's reasons, summary
- #### Socrates' sons
- #### Crito's reputation
- #### Cowardly to remain in prison; it's the easy way out
	- Being complicit and perpetuating injustice instead of standing up to it
- #### Resources are available


### [[Formalization]], [[Socrates]]' sons:
#### P1: By escaping and remaining alive, you could educate and raise your sons, but remaining in prison would not allow you to do so
#### P2: Therefore, accepting your fate, you show no concern for your sons
#### P3: Those who have children should be involved in raising and educating them
#### P4: Therefore, you will be violating your duty to your children by accepting execution

#### C: Therefore, it is wrong to remain in prison


#### Crito pleads with [[Socrates]], letting him know it would be a great misfortune to him if he died, along with all of Socrates' other friends


##### 44e - Crito affirms [[Socrates]] that they have considered all the possible consequences for freeing him and they are willing to risk it all and worse if necessary
- 45a - Crito affirms that he has the financial aspect of the escape covered


### Journal entry 1a
45d - Crito convicts [[Socrates]], that giving up his own life is unjust if he can save it
- Betraying his sons, depriving them of education and a father





48c - "As for those questions you raise about money, reputation, the upbringing of children, Crito, those considerations in truth belong to those people who easily put men to death and would bring them to life again if they could, without thinking; I mean the majority of men."
- [[Socrates]] assumes the position of most men, that they would kill and raise from the dead if they were capable of it



#### 49b - [[Socrates]] and Crito concur that whether the majority agree or not, wrongdoing and injustice is in every way harmful and shameful to the wrongdoer
- ###### There are two types of people: 
	- those that believe you should never do wrong in return
	- those that think it can be justified
- ###### Very few people hold themselves to the first view
- ##### [[Socrates]] holds himself to the first


### [[Formalization]], Argument from Harm

#### P1: We must never harm another, even when they have harmed us
#### P2: Escaping would nullify the laws of [[Athens]], and the court's verdict
#### P3: Therefore, escaping would harm [[Athens]]
#### C: Therefore, it's wrong to escape


### [[Formalization]], Argument from Unequal Footing
#### P1: The city had a role in my parent's marriage, my education, and my upbringing
#### P2: I am therefore the city's offspring and servant and not on equal footing
#### P3: Therefore when they act against me, I cannot retaliate by undertaking to destroy them
#### P4: Escaping would destroy [[Athens]] by undermining their laws and courts

#### C: Therefore, it's wrong to escape


### [[Formalization]], Argument from Agreement
#### P1: If one voluntary chooses to remain in [[Athens]], they have accepted an agreement to obey the laws
#### P2: I chose to remain in [[Athens]] and raise my children here
#### P3: Therefore, I have accepted this agreement with [[Athens]]
#### P4: Escaping would mean breaking Athenian law, and therefore violating the terms of this agreement
#### C: Therefore it's wrong to escape



#### [[Socrates]] asks if by leaving the prison without the city's permission they are breaking an agreement
- #### Crito doesn't have an answer
##### Socrates goes on, saying he can be convicted by a hypothetical orator of intending to destroy the people, the laws, and the city by defiantly suggesting that an individual can nullify a court decision
- Do they then say the city wronged him, and the city is incorrect?
	- Crito says yes

##### 51d - Socrates speaks again as the hypothetical orator 
- The city brought him to birth, nurtured him, educated him - why would [[Socrates]] have the right to destroy it?
- ##### The city is to be honored more than your father, mother and ancestors
	- ##### You have to persuade it or obey it
	- When someone disobeys it, they do wrong in 3 ways: 
		- disobeys his parents, those who brought him up, and doesn't persuade the city to do better

#### [[Socrates]] already made it clear multiple times in [[Apology]] that he would rather die than live in exile
- Has he no shame?

#### Socrates was in [[Athens]] for most of his life, choosing it over living in [[Sparta]] or [[Crete]] 




## Debate

### Reasons to remain in Prison:
#### 1. Causing harm would be impious and invalidate his claims to search for what is pious
- Most people believe what is pious is what is accepted by the Gods, after all, that's what [[Euthyphro]] teaches - Apollo has recognized through the Oracle that [[Socrates]] is the wisest man alive - why would the Gods approve of killing the wisest man alive?
#### 2. Escaping would not be beneficial
- ##### [[Athens]]-like cities would regard him as a fugitive/outcast, wouldn't respect
	- ##### Non-[[Athens]] like city would not have the capacity to improve
- Socrates himself has confirmed that those who are ignored are wiser than those of high status

### Reasons to Escape:
#### 1. Accepting the death penalty would mean that [[Socrates]] couldn't continue to help people
- His students could carry on his work
#### 2. Perpetuating injustice - condoning abuse of the court system
- Failing to abide by the courts is ALSO an abuse to the court system
