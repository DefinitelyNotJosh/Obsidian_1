##### Proposed in the 1950s by Smart, Lewis, etc.
#### All mental states are brain states

Pain is "C-Fiber activation" (placeholder, not exact)
Fear is the activation of the amygdala

#### Numerical Identity
**"C-Fiber Activation" is the same thing as "pain," just as "H2O" and "water" are the same**
#### TYPE Identity
**All instances of pain are instances of C-Fiber activation**
- NOT making the assumption that all pain is the same
	- All toe-stubbing pain has the same neural correlate in every person, as does grief, being stabbed, etc

#### Support 1
1. Consistent correlations between brain states and mental states
	1. Researchers have documented correspondence between brain activity and experience
	2. Certain kinds of brain damage will have predictable impacts on cognitive functioning
2. Best explanation for these correlations is identity

#### Support 2
Analogous to other scientific discoveries

P1: The discovery of other scientific identities began w folk concepts that were later discovered to be nothing more than physical properties and processes
P2: Our understanding of psychological states is following the same course
C: Therefore we have good reason to think that psychological states will be discovered to be nothing more than physical properties and processes

#### Support 3
[[Principle of Parsimony - Ockham's Razer]]
- The identity theory is simpler than dualism -> simplicity = how many entities exist in the universe to explain the phenomena
No causal interaction problem


### Problem:
[[Leibniz' Principle - The Indiscernibility of Identity]]
